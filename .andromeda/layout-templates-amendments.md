# layout-templates — amendments

One entry per amendment to `layout-templates.md` (sidecar-contract.md §Entry form). Appended at wrap P2; rewritten only by the epoch-close consolidation.

## 2026-10-06-headless-stand — the headless stand's TaskShell mount; seven_guis citations re-pointed
**Section:** §Surface: desktop-native → Primary screens (seven_guis Home and TaskShell)
**Change:** the seven_guis entry adds the headless stand: it skips Home and mounts one lean task (Counter, FlightBooker, Timer, Crud) in TaskShell through `task_in_shell` — `main#main > #task-shell`, `#task-header > #back-btn + #task-title` above `#task-body` — at the pinned 800 × 600, scale 1.0, Light viewport with the bundled DejaVu Sans; its `app.rs` citations re-pointed to Home, TaskShell and the CSS constants after the chunk's line shift.
**Why:** the headless stand chunk added a second way into TaskShell; the windowed Home → TaskShell flow is unchanged.
