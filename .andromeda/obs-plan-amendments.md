# obs-plan — amendments

One entry per amendment to `obs-plan.md` (sidecar-contract.md §Entry form). Appended at wrap P2; rewritten only by the epoch-close consolidation.

## 2026-10-05-fork-ci-reached — per-leg CI failure logs; WPT and publish telemetry upstream-only
**Section:** §5 Metric Coverage (WPT scores (CI)) · §6 Log Coverage (CI publish builds) · §9 CI Integration (Telemetry artifact handling · publish-build logging · NOT YET MEASURED)
**Change:** §9 gains a row: each ci.yml leg's merged stdout+stderr, written by `ci-leg.sh` to `target/ci-logs/{leg}.log` (matrix `target/ci-logs/matrix-{platform}.log`), truncated at the leg's start, uploaded only on failure as `ci-log-{job id}` (`if-no-files-found: ignore`), kept 7 days, from `target/ci-logs/` alone, unscrubbed build output carrying no user data. The NOT YET MEASURED line was "log-file and snapshot artifact upload, CI resource attributes and artifact retention"; now "snapshot artifact upload and CI resource attributes". The WPT report archive and dispatch, `wptscores.json`, the §5 WPT-scores metric and the publish-build `CARGO_LOG` trace logging (§6, §9) are now marked upstream `DioxusLabs/blitz` only — their jobs are repository-guarded.
**Why:** a failing leg must be diagnosable without a re-run (the chunk's failure-artifact acceptance); the upload path is confined to `target/ci-logs/` so no artifact reaches the keystore or `Dioxus.toml`.

## 2026-10-05-fork-ci-reached — file:line citations re-pointed after the CI files moved
**Section:** every section citing `Cargo.toml`, `wpt.yml` or `publish-browser.yml` lines
**Change:** 8 citations re-pointed — `Cargo.toml` from line 195 on +3, `wpt.yml` from line 26 on +1, `publish-browser.yml` from line 37 on +1; no claim text changed by the re-point.
**Why:** this chunk moved the cited lines.
