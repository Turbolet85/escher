# arch · standing conventions

- S1 · a new integration test lives in blitz-tests, one target per file, one behaviour per file · design-philosophy · conventions
  decision/blitz-tests-one-target-per-file · One test target per file in blitz-tests — blitz-tests keeps one test target per file. · except: upstream's tests/all.rs, declared and held at test = false.
  decision/blitz-tests-single-test-target · blitz-tests manifest declares one test table — The blitz-tests package keeps test autodiscovery on and declares exactly one test table, `all`, with test set to false. · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest
  decision/blitz-tests-target-per-file · One blitz-tests target per file — blitz-tests keeps one test target per file directly under `tests/`, setting no `autotests`; upstream's single-binary `tests/all.rs`, the manifest's one `[[test]]` table, is held at `test = false`. · why: Ratified; a standing two-line difference from upstream's manifest. · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest
  decision/integration-test-one-behavior · One behavior per integration test file — Each integration test file covers one behavior and opens with a `//!` doc naming the behavior and any guarded bug.
  decision/integration-tests-in-blitz-tests · Integration tests live in blitz-tests — Integration tests live in the tests directory of the blitz-tests crate.
  decision/shared-test-modules · Shared test modules in subdirectories — The seven_guis stand checks state the tables and helpers they share once, in a `common` module read by `mod common;`, and the checks that hold a `Session` keep theirs in a second such module, `session_common`. · why: A module in a subdirectory of the integration-test directory is no test target, so each test-target file still covers one behavior.
  decision/stand-check-shared-helpers · Stand-check helpers in non-target modules — Stand checks share helpers through modules under the tests directory that are no test target.
- S2 · a new scenario runs in both layout modes · conventions
- S3 · a new test has a descriptive name and asserts its fixture's condition first · conventions
  decision/descriptive-test-names · Descriptive test names — Tests carry descriptive snake_case names.
  decision/tests-assert-fixture-first · Tests assert the fixture first — A test first asserts that its fixture produces the condition under test.
- S4 · expect and unwrap in new code carry a justification, and new modules and public items carry docs · conventions
  decision/justified-expect-unwrap · expect and unwrap need a justification — An allow of `clippy::expect_used` or `clippy::unwrap_used` stands next to a justification. · except: The browser app's test module allows `clippy::expect_used` with no justification beside it.
  decision/module-docs · Module and file docs — Modules and files open with `//!` docs. · except: The driver crate opens every file with `//!`; upstream engine modules largely open without it.
  decision/unwrap-expect-justified · Justified unwrap and expect — `clippy::expect_used` and `clippy::unwrap_used` are allowed only locally, next to a justification.
- S5 · new code keeps its crate's per-crate line coverage floor · stack-and-technologies
  contract/ci-leg-legs/coverage · ci-leg.sh legs · coverage — The `coverage` leg runs `cargo llvm-cov` to an lcov file and its per-file report, then the coverage-floor script, and exits with the floor's status.
  contract/coverage-floor-exit-codes/0 · coverage_floor.py exit codes · 0 — Every crate is at or above its floor, printed as `coverage floor: N of N crates at or above their floors`.
  contract/coverage-floor-exit-codes/1 · coverage_floor.py exit codes · 1 — Some crates are under their floors, printed as `coverage floor: K of N crates under their floors`.
  decision/ci-quality-gates · CI quality gates — Every change passes cargo fmt, clippy with warnings denied, rustdoc with warnings denied over every workspace library crate, a cargo-deny audit of advisories and licences, per-crate coverage floors and a zero-failure stand-repeat budget. · guard: the CI legs of .github/scripts/ci-leg.sh
  decision/coverage-excludes-keyboard-compat · Coverage excludes the keyboard compat bridge — Both coverage measurement lines exclude dioxus-native-dom's crate-private keyboard compat module, the floors unchanged. · why: The module is upstream's temporary keyboard-types 0.7/0.8 bridge, excluded until escher takes upstream's retirement of it. · guard: test_coverage_leg_reaches_the_floor_on_each_crate
  decision/coverage-floors · Per-crate coverage floors — A cargo-llvm-cov coverage report is gated by per-crate floors: CI fails when line coverage falls under 97 % for escher-driver, 83 % for dioxus-native-dom or 90 % for blitz-test-harness. · guard: CoverageFloorTest
  decision/per-crate-coverage-floor · Per-crate coverage floor — CI holds a coverage floor per crate. · guard: coverage_floor.py
  decision/per-crate-coverage-floors · Per-crate line coverage floors — The coverage leg gates line coverage by per-crate floors: escher-driver 97 %, dioxus-native-dom 83 %, blitz-test-harness 90 %. · guard: coverage_floor.py
- S6 · a new Dioxus fixture or example keeps the Dioxus example shape and registers its signals with the graph · conventions
  contract/dioxus-bridge/use-graph-state · Dioxus DOM bridge · use_graph_state — An app registers graphed state through the ungated use_graph_state.
  decision/dioxus-example-shape · Dioxus example shape — Dioxus examples declare `dioxus_native::launch(app)` with `#[component]` components and signal and store hooks, their CSS in `const` raw strings.
  decision/example-css-const · Example CSS in a const string — Example CSS is held in a `const CSS: &str` raw string emitted in a `style` element, some named `STYLES`.
  decision/first-graph-state-hook-provides-registry · First graph-state hook provides the root signal registry — The first graph-state hook of a page provides a `SignalRegistry` context at the root scope, which the bridge's dispatch looks up; a page that registers no state has none. · why: The bridge's dispatch and the UI graph look the registry up at the root scope; pinned by a_dispatch_is_recorded_where_a_state_is_registered_and_acts_as_before_where_none_is
  decision/graph-state-by-registration · UI graph state reached by registration — App state is reachable for the UI graph only when registered through use_graph_state; hook-local use_signal state an app does not register is not reached. · why: dioxus-core keeps a scope's hooks crate-private, so hook-local state needs a fork-level change
  decision/reactive-state-store-derive · Reactive state derives Store — Reactive state in apps and examples uses the Store derive.
  decision/seven-guis-graph-signals · seven_guis signals registered with the graph — seven_guis' tasks register each signal through the tasks module's graph-signal hook, which wraps the plain signal and graph-state hooks; plain signals are left to the stand shell's `active` and the stand's `linked`.
