- S1 · each new check is silent and shares its helpers through the shared test modules; it prints nothing it reads · 3-observability-harness-contract
  decision/checks-silent · Silent checks and shared modules — Checks, their shared modules and the stand-ins they use install no subscriber, read no environment variable and print nothing, their readings going into assertions only, and the code they pin adds no log site, span, field or env read. · except: Checks whose subject is telemetry install escher's sink, the MCP tools check its own recorder, the paint-tree bench reads one opt-in env var, and a re-run child prints ids its parent reads.
- S2 · each new check that asserts an empty stderr unsets RUST_LOG for the child it runs · 3-observability-harness-contract
  decision/empty-stderr-check-unsets-rust-log · Empty-stderr checks unset RUST_LOG — A check that reads an accepted command's empty stderr removes RUST_LOG from the spawned child's environment.
- S3 · each new kept check or fixture committed to the tree holds no secrets and no private data · 9-ci-integration · ci-integration
- S4 · no answer-bearing type is logged through Debug by any new code or test · 3-observability-harness-contract
  decision/debug-types-never-logged · Answer-bearing types never logged — Types that derive Debug and hold ids, accessible names, control values or page text are never logged, fielded or printed with Debug; a command's outcome is written in one place, as the command's answer.
  decision/reached-record-ids-and-events-only · Reached record holds ids and event names only — The reached record holds stable ids and event names only, no node number, and its debug form prints its count alone. · why: the reached module's tests pin id and event rows and the_records_debug_prints_its_count_alone; handler coverage reads the record through reached_handlers
