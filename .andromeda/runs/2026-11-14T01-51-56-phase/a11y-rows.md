# a11y-plan · the rows that bind 2026-11-14-seeded-randomness — picked 38 of 240 (19 by every draw) · rule any · pin 741

## a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin 1-a11y-scope-summary
decision/driver-requires-accessibility · Session library always enables accessibility — The escher-driver session library enables accessibility on dioxus-native-dom unconditionally, with no feature table of its own, so the feature reaches every binary that depends on it. · why: Its executor reads the snapshot, which stands behind that feature.

## 2-a11y-strategy · ## 2. A11y Strategy · twin a11y-strategy
decision/accessibility-tree-through-document-method · Accessibility tree built through the document's own method — The accessibility tree is built from the document on the initial tree request and rebuilt when a poll takes a non-empty changed set, both paths going through the document trait's accessibility-tree method. · why: so a wrapper's override, such as DioxusDocument's stable ids, reaches the tree

## a11y-strategy · ## 2. A11y Strategy · twin 2-a11y-strategy
decision/a11y-tree-refresh-on-change · Accessibility tree refreshed on change — The accessibility tree is built from the document when first requested and rebuilt on a poll whose drained changed set was non-empty. · why: Ratified, one item with the engine's changed-set contract. · guard: stand_accessibility_ids
decision/agent-readers-behind-accessibility · Snapshot readers behind the accessibility feature — The snapshot, its text and diff, the unkeyed-actionable check, the UI graph reader and the actionable-node reader stand behind dioxus-native-dom's accessibility feature; the signal registry and the reached-handler record are not gated.
decision/changed-set-marks · What the engine's changed set marks — The engine's changed set marks a mutation of an in-document node, a focus or checked change, a text control's input, a select's changed choice and a single select's list opening or closing, a scroll that closes a list included; node creation, hover, active, any other scroll and layout do not. · why: Ratified, one item with the accessibility tree's refresh on change.
decision/harness-settle-leaves-changed-set · Harness settle leaves the changed set — A harness settle neither reads nor drains the changed set, and a freshly booted harness document holds a non-empty set, so a check that reads the set as what one step changed drains it first. · why: A settled step leaves the refresh and a later diff exactly what the step marked. · guard: stand_settle
decision/a11y-tree-through-document-trait · Accessibility tree through the document trait — Both the initial build and the refresh of the platform accessibility tree go through the document trait's accessibility tree method. · why: So a wrapper's override, such as DioxusDocument's stable ids, reaches the platform tree.
decision/aria-description-to-adapter · ARIA description to the platform adapter — The aria-describedby and aria-description attributes reach the platform adapter as the node's description; the snapshot reads no description. · why: Ratified as upstream's behaviour. · guard: accessibility_description

## 3-a11y-assertion-harness-contract · ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/a11y-ci-leg · The a11y CI leg — The CI job "Accessibility (a11y) tests" runs the accessibility integration tests as their own leg, on one cargo test line in the slow tier, with no required status check. · why: The existing a11y job was widened rather than a new job, required status check or repository setting added, by the chosen option. · guard: LegScriptTest's a11y tuple

## keyboard-navigation · ## 5. Keyboard Navigation · twin 5-keyboard-navigation
decision/driver-type-focuses-select-no-click · Driver type focuses a select with no click — The driver's type on a select focuses it with no click and adds nothing to the driver's closed sets of verbs, arguments, key names, result fields, causes, session errors or exits. · why: pinned by type_leaves_no_list_open_and_chooses_by_its_text in the stand_act_popup driver tests

## 6-visual-design-verification · ## 6. Visual Design Verification · twin visual-design-verification
contract/accessibility-tree/hidden-and-inert-nodes · accessibility tree · hidden and inert nodes — Nodes with display: none or visibility: hidden or carrying inert, and their descendants, are excluded from the accessibility tree and the snapshot, a select's option excepted from display: none.

## visual-design-verification · ## 6. Visual Design Verification · twin 6-visual-design-verification
decision/hidden-content-excluded-from-a11y-tree · Hidden content excluded from the accessibility tree — Nodes with `display: none`, `visibility: hidden` or carrying `inert`, and their descendants, are excluded from the accessibility tree and so from the snapshot. · except: A select's options are excepted from `display: none`, so they stand under the select in the tree and the snapshot, directly or through an `optgroup`.

## 7-screen-reader-support · ## 7. Screen Reader Support · twin screen-reader-support
decision/actionable-key-rule · Actionable-key rule — Every element an agent can act on (focusable, carrying an interactive role or an event listener) reads an author key, so its author_id is that key and holds under any edit of the code around it. · why: ratified · guard: unkeyed_actionable
decision/snapshot-model-single-source · Snapshot model as single source — The snapshot's text form, parts, diff, MCP results, node-key help and screenshot read the snapshot model and nothing else.
decision/snapshot-reads-accessibility-tree · Snapshot reads the accessibility tree — The snapshot takes each node's role, name, focus, selected, pressed and invalid from the accessibility tree, never from the element.
contract/accessibility-tree/author-id · accessibility tree · author_id — In a Dioxus document every element node carries its stable element id as AccessKit author_id; no TextRun, document-root or Window node carries one.
contract/snapshot/clickable · snapshot · clickable — The snapshot's clickable field says an element that is no disabled form control reacts to a click, read from the vdom walk's current click listeners and not the listener mark.
contract/snapshot/value · snapshot · value — The snapshot's value is read from the element: the editor's text, else a range input's current value, else the value attribute.

## screen-reader-support · ## 7. Screen Reader Support · twin 7-screen-reader-support
decision/keyed-wire-form · The keyed field on the carriers — The keyed reading on the actions answer is the actionable-key check's wire form, true where the id holds no slash.
decision/readers-of-one-snapshot-model · One snapshot model, many readers — The text form, the diff, the text parts, MCP tool results, the node keys' help and the screenshot read only the one snapshot model, with no second role or name mapping.
decision/snapshot-reads-the-tree · Snapshot takes its readings from the tree — The snapshot takes each node's role, name, focus and its selected, pressed and invalid readings from the accessibility tree, never from the element, with no second role or name mapping.
decision/text-runs-label-their-parent · Text runs label their parent element — Text nodes become TextRun nodes carrying their text, and their parent is labelled by them, so an element's text reaches its accessible name. · why: accessible names of buttons and controls come from it; pinned by every_interactive_role_element_reads_a_name and role_and_name_match_the_accessibility_tree
contract/snapshot-diff/differs · the snapshot diff · differs — A changed node names the readings that differ from before the step, in node-key order.
contract/snapshot-diff/entries · the snapshot diff · entries — Two snapshots are compared by stable element id, entries carrying the later role and name; a text change is reported on the element whose name it changes, never as a text-run entry.
contract/snapshot-text/clickable · the snapshot text form · clickable — The token clickable is written after focused only when true.
contract/snapshot-text/parts · the snapshot text form · parts — A screen over the text budget is read in parts of consecutive pre-order lines, never a split line, concatenating to the whole text with every node id on exactly one line.
contract/snapshot-text/state-tokens · the snapshot text form · state tokens — Each node is one line; selected or unselected, pressed or unpressed and invalid are written after value= and before focused.
decision/accessibility-feature-gate · Screen-reader integration behind the accessibility feature — Screen-reader integration through AccessKit is exposed only behind the `accessibility` feature, in blitz via blitz-shell and in the Dioxus crates.
decision/actions-verb-changes-nothing · The actions verb changes nothing — Answering the actions verb moves no focus, snapshot or diff, and an open list stays open.
decision/boolean-state-limits · Limits of the boolean state model — A mixed toggle reads pressed false and a grammar or spelling error reads invalid true, the node keeping its full value.
decision/driver-schema-has-no-role-set · Driver schema defines no role or name set — The driver's schema defines no role or name set of its own; role and name are field names of its result nodes.
decision/listeners-from-vdom-walk · Listeners read from the vdom walk — An element's current listeners are read from the vdom walk's dynamic attributes, never from the bridge's listener mark, so a listener removed on a re-render is not counted. · why: the bridge's listener attributes over-report: a removed listener leaves its event attribute and data-dioxus-id mark standing · guard: a_listener_removed_on_a_re_render_is_read_by_neither_reader
contract/accessibility-tree/focus · the accessibility tree · focus — Tree focus is the focused DOM node only where that node is among the built nodes, else u64::MAX, the window, so the tree never names a node it did not build.
contract/actionable-nodes/listing · actionable nodes · listing — The list holds, in snapshot pre-order, the UI graph's nodes the actionable rule holds for or whose owner is set, each with id, owner and keyed.
contract/actions-answer/causes · the actions answer · causes — For every actionable node each verb taking an id is answered with the cause a check would refuse it with; a node resolving to no element reads stale.
contract/actions-answer/fields · the actions answer · fields — The answer writes ids, owner ids, verb and cause words and booleans only, never a value, typed text, MASKED_VALUE or NodeId.
contract/mcp-result/snapshot · MCP tool results · snapshot — An accepted snapshot result is the text form itself for a whole screen, and for a screen in parts the JSON line {text, part, parts}; an acting call's result is its JSON line with the diff.
contract/snapshot-node/clickable · the snapshot node · clickable — clickable is true where the element's current listeners hold click and it is no disabled form control; the JSON node always carries it beside focused.

## 1-a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin a11y-scope-summary
> NOT YET MEASURED — must-be-accessible critical paths and a11y triggers: no slice recorded them, and s03 recorded accessibility scope as out of slice.
absence/assistive-technology-reach — A platform accessibility adapter in any stand binary, so no active assistive technology is given a tree

## 2-a11y-strategy · ## 2. A11y Strategy · twin a11y-strategy
> NOT YET MEASURED — a stated accessibility strategy (POUR coverage depth, agent-runnable invariants, naming conventions): no slice states one, and s01, s02, s03, s06, s07, s08, s10 and s13 recorded accessibility strategy as out of slice.

## 3-a11y-assertion-harness-contract · ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
> NOT YET MEASURED — the structured violation JSON schema / log format, the WCAG criteria mapping of the existing tests and a screen-reader test pattern: no slice recorded them (s01, s02, s06, s07 and s13 recorded the a11y assertion harness as out of slice). The obs log format is now measured for escher's own sink (obs plan §3, §6 Log Coverage, §8): non-JSON text lines on stderr in two record classes — one line per printed event, `{RFC 3339 UTC time} {LEVEL} {target} service.name=… service.version=… {field}={value}…`, and, since 2026-10-07-driver-command-spans, one line per closed span of an admitted target, the same prefix then `span={the span's name}`, the span's recorded fields and the layer's close fields `message`, `time.busy` and `time.idle`, with no line when a span is created, recorded to, entered or exited (the second class was ratified by the founder, 2026-10-09, as obs plan §6 states) — both behind a target allowlist that, among others, prints only `node_id` / `status` / `waiting_nodes` / `property` / `log.*` fields for `blitz*` and `accesskit_xplat` targets, redacts `text`, `value`, `html` and `attrs` for escher's own targets (`escher_*`) and drops a record from any other target whole, at every level — a closed span's every pair judged by the same rule, an outside target's span writing nothing; an a11y violation schema is not yet defined against it.

## 5-keyboard-navigation · ## 5. Keyboard Navigation · twin keyboard-navigation

## 6-visual-design-verification · ## 6. Visual Design Verification · twin visual-design-verification
> NOT YET MEASURED — focus-ring, target-size and typography-readability tokens: no slice recorded them, and s01 and s07 recorded contrast and visual checks as out of slice. The stand controls' contrast pairs are measured since 2026-10-13-stand-contrast-harness (Color contrast above), and the CRUD list rows, the text outside the controls and the colour states reached by input, hover and active included, since 2026-10-14-stand-a11y-assertions.
