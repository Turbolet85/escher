## design-philosophy · ## Design Philosophy
decision/layout-modes-identical · Both layout modes give identical layouts — Both layout modes produce identical layouts.
contract/dioxus-document/handle-ui-event · The Dioxus document · handle_ui_event — UI events are pushed into the document through it.
decision/headless-measurable-testable · Headless, measurable, testable engine — The engine is exercised without a window through a headless harness, a WPT runner and phase-split benchmarks.
decision/headless-test-harness · Headless test harness — The engine is tested without a window, GPU or compositor, and synthesized input routes through the real event-dispatch pipeline.
decision/injected-embedder-services · Embedder services injected, with no-op defaults — Networking, navigation, shell and parsing reach the DOM only through provider traits the embedder supplies, and a provider not supplied falls back to a no-op default.
decision/one-incremental-pipeline · One pipeline for incremental and full layout — Incremental and non-incremental layout run the same style, damage, box construction and layout pipeline, non-incremental marking every node damaged each resolve, and both must produce identical layouts after any sequence of mutations. · guard: incremental_oracle
contract/dioxus-document/poll · The Dioxus document · poll — Changes are flushed to the DOM through it.

## stack-and-technologies · ## Stack and Technologies
decision/ci-scripts-python-floor · Python 3.11 floor for the ci-scripts leg — The `ci-scripts` leg needs Python 3.11 or later.
decision/ci-scripts-stdlib-python · CI helper scripts on the Python stdlib — The CI helper scripts, the coverage floor among them, use the Python stdlib and PyYAML, which the ci-scripts leg installs when absent; that leg needs Python 3.11 or later for tomllib. · why: no package added
decision/cognitive-complexity-ceiling · Cognitive complexity ceiling — A cognitive-complexity reading on the dev host alone, never in CI, reads each function against a ceiling of 15 with rust-code-analysis-cli.
decision/parley-text-layout · Parley for text and fonts — Parley 0.12 with fontique does text layout, editing and fonts, with skrifa for font metrics and wuff for WOFF and WOFF2.
decision/serde-json-driver-reader · serde_json as the driver's JSON reader — serde_json is escher-driver's reader of MCP requests, of kept checks and of the live answer line a replay compares. · why: already in the graph through dioxus-html
decision/workspace-keyboard-types-path · Workspace keyboard-types named by absolute path — A module that glob-imports the Dioxus prelude names the workspace's keyboard-types crate as `::keyboard_types`. · why: two keyboard-types versions stand in the graph, Dioxus carrying its own 0.7

## established-decisions · ## Established Decisions
decision/coverage-reads-named-checks · Coverage role reads named check files — The command line's `coverage` role reads kept-check files its caller names on argv, bounded and read strictly. · why: a ratified boundary widening
decision/coverage-role-reads-named-checks · Coverage role reads kept checks its caller names — The command line's coverage role, coverage <app> <check>..., reads kept-check file paths its caller names, each read bounded and parsed as a check; an unreadable, over-bound, non-check or other-app file is refused malformed holding nothing of the path. · why: A boundary widening, ratified; no new socket message, MCP tool, verb, cause, span field or dependency.
decision/cross-process-session-unsupported-on-windows · Cross-process session unsupported on Windows — On Windows the cross-process lifecycle and a call sent across it return Unsupported, while a session held in process works on every target. · why: Windows has no std local socket.
decision/document-clock · The document's clock — Every engine time read goes through the document's configured clock, wall time when it is unset and a virtual clock headlessly, a sub-document carrying its parent's clock, with every timing constant unchanged. · why: ratified; an API addition whose default keeps every windowed and embedder-built document's behaviour
decision/driver-library-side-effect-free · Driver library without side channels — The driver library depends on no app, emits no event, installs no subscriber and reads no env var.
decision/driver-spans-only · Driver opens spans and emits no event — The driver opens one tracing span per call it runs and one tool_call span per MCP tools/call request, and emits no event, installs no subscriber, reads no env var and has no default state location.
decision/fixed-program-text-on-carriers · Program's fixed text rides the ratified carriers — The command line's stdout and the mcp role's stdio carry the program's own fixed text, static data of the one table (help, a session error's remedy, each tool's description and result fields); text from a page, a call or a screen, a new carrier or a new exit still widens. · why: Ratified; no dependency added.
decision/graph-state-by-registration · UI graph state reached by registration — App state is reachable for the UI graph only when registered through use_graph_state; hook-local use_signal state an app does not register is not reached. · why: dioxus-core keeps a scope's hooks crate-private, so hook-local state needs a fork-level change
decision/hosted-session-idle-expiry · Hosted session idle expiry — A hosted session expires: a host a command line starts takes IDLE_EXPIRY of 1,800 s, and a host that has answered no request for that long ends exactly as on stop; every answered request, a refused or malformed one included, starts the count again. · why: Answers the orphaned-host question.
decision/idle-session-expiry · Hosted sessions expire when idle — A hosted driver session expires when idle.
decision/kept-check-masking · Kept check keeps masking — A kept check records a masked or unresolved type as one fixed stand-in, and keeps each answer as a 64-bit digest and whole, masked as on every carrier, a shot's without its pixels.
decision/kept-check-never-logged · Kept check never logged — A kept check's screens, ids, names, values, snapshot text, diffs, findings, graph and actions answers rest at rest only, never logged and never named by a tool call.
decision/kept-check-replays-through-run · Kept check replays through the one run path — A kept check replays through the session's one call-running path alone, and a coverage role reading one from a named path bounds the read at the check size limit plus one byte.
decision/large-screen-in-parts · Screen over the snapshot budget crosses in parts — A screen over the snapshot budget crosses in parts, a screen within the budget answering whole, with no new verb, carrier, exit, cause, session error, span field or dependency; over MCP a paged answer is its JSON line. · why: A boundary widening, ratified.
decision/mcp-stdio-crossing · Session calls over the MCP role's stdio — A session's calls also cross from an MCP client over the escher-session mcp role's stdio, a child of that client local to the invoking user, holding its session in its own process with no listener. · why: A boundary widening, ratified.
decision/new-carrier-widens-boundary · New carriers widen the session boundary — A new carrier or exit for a driver session is a widening of its boundary.
decision/no-node-id-across-session · No NodeId crosses a session — Only ids, names, masked values, snapshot text, diffs, shots, lint findings, closed words, booleans and counts cross a driver session, never a `NodeId`.
decision/recorded-session-checks · Recorded sessions kept as owner-only checks — A session whose launcher names a recording directory keeps its answered calls at rest as one owner-only replayable check, never logged and never named by a tool call. · except: the repository's two committed stand checks are not owner-only
decision/recorded-session-kept-check · Recorded session kept as a replayable check — A session whose launcher names a recording directory keeps its answered calls at rest as one owner-only replayable check, std only with no dependency added, unix only like the socket. · except: The repository's own two scripted stand checks are committed in git, the one exception to owner-only.
decision/serde-json-reader-only · serde_json as a reader only — The driver takes serde_json from the workspace with no feature, as a reader of MCP requests, of kept checks and of the live answer line a replay compares, writing nothing. · why: Ratified as read only.
decision/session-library-depends-on-no-app · Session library depends on no app — The driver's session library takes the app's boot from its caller and depends on no app; no manifest under packages names an example, and the one edge runs from the app to the driver.
decision/session-over-unix-socket · Driver session over a std-only Unix socket — A driver session crosses processes on a std-only Unix-domain socket in an owner-only state directory and on the `mcp` role's stdio, with no third-party IPC, named-pipe, pid-file or daemonizing crate and no TCP or UDP port. · why: a deliberate transport choice
decision/socket-carries-driver-calls · Session socket carries driver calls — The session socket carries the session's lifecycle and a driver call and its answer: a call takes an element id and typed text in, an answer takes ids, accessible names, control values (a password's or a file input's as the fixed mask), the snapshot's text and the diff out, and no NodeId crosses. · why: A boundary widening, ratified.
contract/mcp-stdio/request-line · the mcp role's stdio · request line — A request line is at most 65,536 bytes.
contract/snapshot-node-state/clickable · the snapshot's node state · clickable — True where the element holds a current click listener and is not a form control reported disabled, so a disabled button with a listener reads not clickable and a div with disabled and a listener reads clickable.
contract/snapshot-node/clickable · the snapshot node · clickable — Each snapshot node carries the closed bool clickable.
contract/tool-call-span/tool · tool_call span · tool — The table's word for the tool, absent for an unknown tool; one of the two fields the tool_call span under the target escher_driver holds, beside ending and no other.
decision/actions-answer-crossing · Actions answer crosses the carriers — The actions answer crosses the session socket's call, the command line and MCP and rests in a kept check as the actions verb's answer, holding stable ids, owner ids, the table's verb words, the closed cause words and booleans, never a value, typed text or NodeId. · why: A boundary widening, ratified; no new carrier, exit, cause, session error, span field or dependency.
decision/click-after-scroll-advances-past-fade · Click after scroll waits out the scrollbar fade — A driver click inside a just-scrolled box advances the virtual clock past the overlay scrollbar's fade first, since a main-button pointerdown in the shown scrollbar band is taken as a thumb drag and dispatches nothing. · why: a measured hazard of the overlay scrollbar, no engine change · except: A row of an open select list is never taken as a thumb drag.
decision/default-font-fallback · Default font when no listed family is available — When none of an element's listed font families is available, the default font is used, for text and for ch and ex metrics alike. · why: an upstream behaviour change taken, ratified for its take
decision/default-generic-font-size · Default generic font size — The default generic base font size is 13px for monospace and 16px otherwise.
decision/differs-closed-set · A changed node's differs is a closed set — A changed node's differs crosses the carriers as a closed set.
decision/headless-documents-default-threading · Headless documents keep default style threading — No headless document — harness, stand or driver — sets style threading.
decision/input-control-data-at-construction · Input control data at construction — Text, checkbox, radio and range inputs get their control data at construction.
contract/mcp-stdio/request-id · the mcp role's stdio · request id — The request id is echoed, an integer or a string of at most 128 bytes.
contract/mcp-stdio/result · the mcp role's stdio · result — A result is at most 1,048,576 bytes.

## conventions · ## Conventions
decision/blitz-tests-one-target-per-file · One test target per file in blitz-tests — blitz-tests keeps one test target per file. · except: upstream's tests/all.rs, declared and held at test = false.
decision/blitz-tests-target-per-file · One blitz-tests target per file — blitz-tests keeps one test target per file directly under `tests/`, setting no `autotests`; upstream's single-binary `tests/all.rs`, the manifest's one `[[test]]` table, is held at `test = false`. · why: Ratified; a standing two-line difference from upstream's manifest. · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest
decision/const-declared-writers · Task writers written as const — A seven_guis task's writers, a `&'static [DeclaredWrite]`, are written `const { &[…] }` or as a `const` item. · why: A bare slice of writes is a temporary not promoted to `'static` and errors `E0716` at the parameter.
decision/do-not-reorder-marker · Ordering-sensitive block marker — An ordering-sensitive block is marked "WARNING: DO NOT REORDER".
decision/driver-hand-built-spans · Driver spans built by hand — escher-driver builds its spans by hand, with no `#[instrument]`.
decision/fixtures-test-module · Shared fixtures test module — A `fixtures` test module, read by `mod fixtures;`, states once the fixture boot and hold, the fixture pages more than one check reads and the held network stand-in `HeldNet`; a page with one reader stays in its check's file.
decision/scenarios-both-layout-modes · Scenarios in both layout modes — Scenarios run in both layout modes.
decision/shared-fixtures-stated-once · Shared blitz-tests fixtures stated once — The blitz-tests fixture module states the fixture boot and hold, the shared fixture pages and the held network stand-in once.
decision/track-caller-row-helpers · Track-caller assertion helpers — Assertion helpers are `#[track_caller]`; the MCP listing test and the requirement-sweep test keep their outer assertions and row walk in the test function and assert each row through private ones whose messages name the row and index only.
decision/both-layout-modes · Scenarios in both layout modes — Test scenarios run in both layout modes, incremental off and on. · except: upstream-taken blitz-tests targets are kept as taken even where they run one layout mode; escher's own targets run both
decision/ci-python-unittest · CI Python tests use unittest — The CI Python tests use `unittest`, one `TestCase` per function.
decision/error-enums · Error types as enums — Error types are enums with `Display` and a `From` per wrapped error.
decision/shared-test-modules · Shared test modules in subdirectories — The seven_guis stand checks state the tables and helpers they share once, in a `common` module read by `mod common;`, and the checks that hold a `Session` keep theirs in a second such module, `session_common`. · why: A module in a subdirectory of the integration-test directory is no test target, so each test-target file still covers one behavior.

## standard-contracts · ## Standard Contracts
decision/advance-moves-session-clock · Advance moves the session's clock — An advance moves the session's clock by exactly the asked milliseconds on every session, and the app's own time through a caller's time step where one was handed; a session with no time step still takes advance, which moves its clock alone; advance reports the clock's move. · why: Ratified.
decision/advanced-ms-is-the-clock-move · advanced_ms reports the clock's move — An advance's advanced_ms is exactly the milliseconds asked, the clock's move, and its diff can be non-empty on any animated page. · why: Ratified.
decision/capability-statement-matches-schema · Capability statement held to the driver schema — The capability statement and README name every verb and refusal cause and state in words the counts of verbs, refusal causes, session errors, node keys and exit statuses that the driver schema holds. · guard: CapabilityStatementTest
decision/driver-logs-no-content · Driver logs no content — Nothing in escher-driver logs an id, a name or a value.
decision/harness-counts-loads-at-net-provider · Harness counts loads at the net provider — A supplied non-noop net provider is wrapped in a counting provider that counts a request in flight until its handler is consumed or dropped and forwards errors; an offline harness or a wrapped document is read through its pending critical resources alone. · why: Loads are counted where every request crosses.
decision/input-helpers-do-not-settle · Input helpers do not settle — Pump, tick, advance-time, dispatch and every input helper settle nothing; settling is asked for separately.
decision/measured-limits-stated-in-the-tool · Measured limits stated where an agent reads the tool — A measured limit of the driver is stated where an agent reads the tool, in the fixed help texts of the verb table, the cause texts and the node keys' help. · why: Ratified.
decision/no-echo-of-typed-input · No echo of typed input — No driver command's ending writes back anything the caller typed.
decision/no-node-id-crosses-the-socket · Calls and outcomes cross as lines, no NodeId — Across the socket a call travels as a request line and its outcome or refusal comes back as one line of JSON, and no engine NodeId is in either. · why: Ratified.
decision/no-seed-on-carriers · No seed crosses the driver's carriers — No run seed crosses the driver's carriers: no verb, argument, command-line flag, MCP tool field, kept-check key or span field carries one, so every driver session and every kept check's replay reads the default seed; a seed reaches a run only from in-process code that builds its VirtualDom. · why: A seed on a carrier would widen the session boundary; the absence is the operator's answer A to the founder's fork, standing PROVISIONAL until the founder confirms or replaces it. · provisional
decision/one-self-description-for-cli-and-mcp · One self-description for command line and MCP — The command line's help and the MCP server's help tool serve the same bytes, the program's own fixed text read from the schema's tables, reading no environment and printing nothing. · why: Ratified as the one table riding the ratified carriers.
decision/one-virtual-clock · One virtual clock per harness — The harness holds one virtual clock its built documents share; only tick and advance-time move it, a negative or non-finite step moving nothing, and screenshot, text contrast and settle never move it; a wrapped document keeps its own clock. · why: Ratified.
decision/refusal-causes-closed-at-eight · Refusal causes closed at eight — The set of refusal causes is closed at eight, each with a fixed name, meaning and remedy, and a refusal holds nothing a call supplied. · why: Ratified.
decision/refused-call-records-no-ids · A call validation refuses records no ids — A call the schema's validation refuses records nothing in the session's record of seen ids; every snapshot a validated call takes is recorded, on a refusal too. · why: Ratified.
decision/replay-hook-after-each-step · Replay calls a hook after each replayed step — Handler coverage relies on the replay calling a hook after each replayed step, so the screen can be read between steps. · why: The driver's coverage role passes a hook to replay_each that reads the screen's reached handlers between steps
decision/screenshot-reads-session-clock · Screenshots read the session's clock — The overlay scrollbar fade reads the session's clock, so two screenshots of one state with no advance between them read the same pixels. · why: Ratified.
decision/seen-ids-record-bounded · Session's record of seen ids bounded — Between calls a session keeps of its screens only id text, at most 4096 ids, never an id longer than a call can name, forgetting the one read longest ago past the bound; the record has no public reader and is never printed or logged. · why: Ratified for ids longer than a call can name. · guard: the_record_holds_no_id_longer_than_a_call_can_name
decision/session-apps-one-table · Session apps from one table — The escher-session usage line's apps and the MCP start tool's enum are written from one private table.
decision/session-moves-clock-not-time-step · Session, not the time step, moves the clock — A stand's time step only delivers the whole timer ticks the asked milliseconds hold, carrying the remainder across calls; the driver session, not the step, moves the harness's clock. · why: Ratified.
decision/settle-never-waits-on-time-or-loads · Settle never waits on loads or time — Settle drives render and layout to quiet, reports a load in flight and never waits on one, and neither waits on nor advances a source only time moves; it reads no clock but the harness's own, logs nothing and starts no thread.
decision/snapshot-text-never-logged · Snapshot text never logged — The snapshot text leaves the process only as a returned value or a hosted call's answer; no log or event carries it, and a kept check holds it only in an owner-only file never logged. · why: Ratified. · except: The two committed checks are the one exception to owner-only.
decision/stand-offline · Stand boots offline — Every stand boot is offline, with no net provider and no base URL. · guard: the_stand_options_stay_offline · except: The load page boot replaces the net provider with its own network stand-in.
decision/stand-pinned-environment · Stand pins its environment — Every headless stand boot uses a pinned 800 by 600 viewport at scale 1.0 in the light colour scheme, installs no telemetry and reads no environment variable.
decision/stand-readings-same-on-every-ci-os · Stand readings identical on every CI OS — The six served stand tasks read the same driver answer digests of snapshot, lint and actions on linux x86_64, windows x86_64 and macOS aarch64, in both layout modes, at boot and after one step, compared with no screenshot. · guard: stand_cross_os_readings
decision/stand-typography-dejavu-sans · Stand typography is DejaVu Sans — Every stand boot loads one font, the bundled DejaVu Sans, with system fonts off, so every generic family and any unavailable named family lays out in DejaVu Sans by fallback; the typography is stated in the stand contract, not on the design-system product surface. · guard: stand_bundled_font_families
decision/tool-call-span-tool-and-ending · MCP tool call span with tool and ending — Each MCP tool call leaves one span carrying only the tool's table word and its ending, the command span of a session run nested under it. · why: Ratified.
decision/validated-commands-only · Driver commands run only after validation — Every driver call runs through the session's one run entry, which validates first; nothing public runs a command that did not come from validation.
decision/validated-verb-set-widened-by-ratification · Validated verb set widened only by ratification — The driver's validated verb set is closed; a verb joins it only as a ratified widening of that set, at the instance, session or tool level. · why: Each verb beyond the first acting verbs joined as a ratified widening of the validated verb set.
contract/answer-json/paged-snapshot · answer JSON · paged snapshot — {"text":…,"part":n,"parts":m} for a part read; a whole screen's answer is {"text":…} alone.
contract/blitz-dom-clock/virtual-clock · blitz-dom clock API · VirtualClock — Clone and Default, every clone reading one shared nanosecond counter; new() reads zero and advance(Duration) adds with saturation.
contract/check-replay/another-app · Check replay · another app — A replay runs nothing on a session whose label is not the check's app.
contract/check-replay/first-difference · Check replay · first difference — Each step's call runs through the session, validated again, and the replay stops at the first step whose acceptance differs or whose live answer is not equal to the kept answer.
contract/cli-coverage-role/1 · Command line coverage role · 1 — A file that cannot be read, one past the bound, one that is no check, or a check whose app is not `<app>` is refused `malformed`, holding nothing of the path or the file.
contract/cli-coverage-role/3 · Command line coverage role · 3 — A boot that fails is the session error.
contract/cli-coverage-role/shape · Command line coverage role · shape — `coverage <app> <check>...` — an app the binary boots, then one or more kept-check paths, no `--session` or `--record`; the binary boots once per check.
contract/cli-exit-statuses/0 · CLI exit statuses · 0 — accepted: the answer on stdout; also the host role's quiet end after a stop or an expiry, and the mcp role's Ok end.
contract/cli-exit-statuses/1 · CLI exit statuses · 1 — refused: the refusal's JSON on stdout.
contract/cli-exit-statuses/2 · CLI exit statuses · 2 — usage: one fixed line on stderr built from the verbs and the app names, stdout empty; includes a --session absent where needed or given twice.
contract/cli-usage-line/role-clauses · Command line usage line · role clauses — The usage line reads `; mcp role: mcp [--record <dir>]`, then `; coverage role: coverage <app> <check>...;` before `; apps:`.
contract/command-line/closed-pipe · command line · closed pipe — A write to a closed pipe is dropped, not a panic, and the ending keeps its status; no ending writes back anything the caller typed.
contract/command-line/help · command line · help — help with no argument and at most one unread --session answers the self-description on stdout, status 0, reaching no session; an argument is refused malformed.
contract/command-line/start · command line · start — start <app> [--record <dir>] spawns the running binary as the host with standard streams closed, waits up to 30 s for it to answer and neither kills nor reaps it; an app the binary does not boot is usage.
contract/command-line/verb-flags · command line · verb flags — --id, --text, --key, --ms and --part each take one value, --shift is bare, and --session <dir> exactly once; the call is validated before the session is asked for.
contract/command-span/cause · command span · cause — The refusal's cause name, recorded for every refused call.
contract/command-span/never-fielded · command span · never fielded — No screen text, image, findings, graph, actions answer, label, id record, argument, call, outcome or refusal value is ever a field.
contract/command-span/verb · command span · verb — Target escher_driver, span command at INFO: the verb table's word, recorded for a known verb, never the caller's text.
contract/driver-recording/handler-coverage · escher-driver recording · handler_coverage — handler_coverage replays kept checks, each on a fresh session, and lists the UI graph's handlers no check exercised.
contract/driver-recording/kept-check · escher-driver recording · kept check — The recording keeps a session's answered calls as a kept check, a masked type as its stand-in and a shot without its pixels.
contract/driver-recording/replay · escher-driver recording · Check::replay — Check::replay runs a kept check's calls again through Session::run.
contract/driver-session/command-schema · escher-driver session · command and refusal schema — The command and refusal schema is stated once as 'static data: fourteen verbs, eight closed causes.
contract/driver-session/load-wait · escher-driver session · LOAD_WAIT — LOAD_WAIT (5 s) bounds an acting step's wait for a load, moving no time.
contract/driver-session/refusal-content · escher-driver session · refusal — No refusal holds what a call supplied.
contract/driver-session/schema-carriers · escher-driver session · schema carriers — The v3 wire, the command line, the MCP server and the command and tool_call spans carry the one command and refusal schema.
contract/driver-verbs/advance · driver verbs · advance — Takes ms, 1 to 60000; one settled step; adds advanced_ms, exactly ms.
contract/driver-verbs/click · driver verbs · click — Takes id; clicks the centre of the element's bounds after the disabled, off-screen and covered checks; a click on a select opens its list.
contract/driver-verbs/help · driver verbs · help — Tool level; no argument; result verbs, node_keys, key_names, busy_classes, causes, exit_statuses and session_errors, each with its help; reaches no session.
contract/driver-verbs/press · driver verbs · press — Takes key and optional shift, false when absent; presses on what holds focus, carrying no Ctrl, so non-adjacent rows of a multiple select cannot be built.
contract/driver-verbs/screenshot · driver verbs · screenshot — One optional id; result width, height and png (base64), always present; an element shot is cropped to its visible bounds; no step, nothing changes.
contract/driver-verbs/scroll · driver verbs · scroll — Takes id; accepted on a disabled or covered element, scrolls it into view as one settled step and adds in_view, always present, false when no scroll could bring it in view or it was removed.
contract/driver-verbs/snapshot · driver verbs · snapshot — One optional part (1 to 1000); reads the screen once, dispatches nothing; result text, plus part and parts when read in parts; a part past the last is the empty text.
contract/driver-verbs/start · driver verbs · start — Session level; takes app; result label, pid and idle_expiry_s.
contract/driver-verbs/type · driver verbs · type — Takes id and text; on a select chooses the first option whose label starts with the text, on a multiple select its match alone, a text opening on a space typing nothing.
contract/escher-session-cli/answer · escher-session command line · answer — escher-session answers one line of JSON.
contract/escher-session-cli/usage · escher-session command line · usage — escher-session <verb> [arguments] --session <dir> drives six served stand tasks: the four lean ones, Cells and the load page.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/0 · escher-session exit codes · 0 — The command was accepted.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/1 · escher-session exit codes · 1 — The command was refused; one line of JSON answers it on stdout.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/2 · escher-session exit codes · 2 — Usage error: a fixed line on stderr, stdout empty, nothing booted and no state created.
contract/escher-session/answer-line · escher-session command line · answer — A command answers one uncoloured line of JSON on stdout.
contract/escher-session/help · escher-session command line · help — Needs no --session, admits at most one and reads it not, reaches no session, and answers the self-description's one line with status 0.
contract/escher-session/mcp · escher-session command line · mcp [--record <dir>] — An MCP server on the binary's standard streams whose start tool boots the same six tasks through the same boot.
contract/escher-session/snapshot · escher-session command line · snapshot — The verb snapshot reads the screen.
contract/escher-session/start · escher-session command line · start <task> [--record <dir>] — The verb start takes a task and an optional --record directory and spawns the host role.
contract/handler-coverage/per-check-boot · Handler coverage reader · per-check boot — A fresh session is booted for each check; a check whose app is not the label runs nothing and contributes nothing.
contract/handler-coverage/reached · Handler coverage reader · reached handlers — The UI graph is read at boot and after each replayed step, `mounted` left out, deduplicated by id and event, and the handlers the replay reached are taken from it.
contract/headless-stand/boot · seven_guis headless stand · seven_guis::stand — seven_guis::stand, native only, boots the four lean tasks, Cells and a load page in a pinned 800x600 Light viewport with one bundled font.
contract/headless-stand/no-telemetry · seven_guis headless stand · telemetry and environment — The stand installs no telemetry, reads no env var and names no blitz_net.
contract/headless-stand/offline-boots · seven_guis headless stand · network — Every stand boot is offline but the load page's, whose one stylesheet fetch the in-process stand-in LoadNet answers after LOAD_ANSWER_DELAY (200 ms).
contract/headless-stand/timer-step · seven_guis headless stand · timer_step — timer_step hands the Timer its ticks for a driver session.

decision/cold-agent-run-adds-no-listener · Cold-agent run adds no listener — The live cold-agent run spawns one claude client that reaches escher-session mcp over stdio only; no listener, port or socket is added, and the client's own messaging socket is the client's, opened by no escher code. · why: ratified
decision/record-dir-launcher-named-private · Recording directory launcher-named and owner-only — The recording directory is named only by the launcher's --record option, never an env read, a default or a tool call, verb, argument or result field; created 0700 when absent and refused RecordDirNotPrivate when open to its group or others.
decision/recording-directory · Recording directory — The recording directory is a path the launcher names by --record, never an env read or a default and named by no tool call, created 0700 and refused when open to its group or others.
decision/stand-load-net-answers-after-delay · Load stand-in answers from its own thread after 200 ms — The stand's LoadNet answers each fetch from a thread of its own with the fixed CSS after 200 ms, with no socket or listener. · why: the_load_page_click_leaves_a_load_in_flight and the stand_load_page checks need a load in flight that the settle waits out
contract/actions-answer/argument · The actions verb's answer · argument — The actions verb takes no argument; a call that gives one is refused malformed.
contract/command-span/actions-call · The command span · actions call — An actions call's command span records verb alone, and cause when refused, parented by its tool_call span under the mcp role.
contract/command-span/graph-call · The command span · graph call — A graph call's command span records verb alone, parented by its tool_call span under the mcp role.
contract/driver-graph/argument · the graph verb · argument — graph takes no argument; a call that gives one is refused malformed with nothing run.
contract/driver-snapshot/clickable · the driver snapshot · clickable — A snapshot node's clickable is a closed bool, crossing in the snapshot and the diff.
contract/driver-snapshot/row-bounds · the driver snapshot · row bounds — An open select list's row carries its own bounds in the snapshot and the diff.
contract/session-socket-wire/non-unix-targets · the session socket's wire · non-unix targets — On targets other than unix the lifecycle and a call return SessionError::Unsupported.

## infrastructure-patterns · ## Infrastructure Patterns
decision/stand-uses-bundled-font · Stand shares the bundled font — seven_guis' bundled DejaVuSans bytes compile on native too, where the headless stand registers the same font.
decision/capabilities-doc-beside-upstream · Capability statement beside upstream docs — escher's capability statement sits in a file of its own under docs, beside upstream's three files. · why: an upstream change under docs never conflicts with it

## cross-cutting-patterns · ## Cross-cutting Patterns
decision/accessibility-feature-gating · Accessibility feature gating in dioxus-native-dom — The `accessibility` feature enables dioxus-native-dom's `accesskit` and gates its accessibility-tree override and its `snapshot`, `snapshot_diff`, `snapshot_text`, `actionable` and `graph` modules; its `signal_registry`, `reached` and `seed` modules stay ungated. · why: An app registers state whatever its features, and the reached record compiles on the wasm build that leaves `accessibility` off.
decision/dioxus-root-contexts · Dioxus services as root contexts — Dioxus services (net provider, HTML parser provider, native document, window event handlers, shell provider, history, renderer, winit window) are provided as root contexts, and apps reach them as contexts.
decision/escher-driver-spans-ungated · escher-driver spans ungated, no subscriber — escher-driver takes `tracing` with no feature, builds its `command` span and its `tool_call` span (the parent of `command` on an MCP tool call) by hand with no instrument attribute and no feature gate, and installs no subscriber.
decision/animations-advance-by-resolve · Animations advance through resolve with a time — Animations, transitions and smooth scrolls advance only through a resolve given a time, and whether any is running is read by an is-animating query. · guard: pseudo_element_update, fragment_navigation
decision/one-run-seed · One seed for a run's randomness — A run's randomness comes from one seed held as a Dioxus root context, ungated by the accessibility feature, so two runs of one seed read the same state at every step, in both layout modes and across processes. · guard: stand_seeded_randomness
decision/reached-recorded-before-handlers · Reached record written before handlers run — Where a reached record is switched on, each node of the dispatch chain whose current listeners hold the event's name is recorded by its stable id before the handlers run. · why: so a handler whose own run removes its element still counts; every other document pays one context lookup per dispatch
decision/runtime-inputs · Runtime inputs — Runtime inputs are CLI arguments and environment variables.

## project-intent · ## Project Intent
decision/capability-statement · Capability statement — docs/capabilities.md is escher's own statement of what it can do and its limits; its verb and cause names and its five counts are held to the driver schema's tables, and no check reads its other claims. · guard: .github/scripts/test_capability_statement.py
contract/capability-statement/sections · The capability statement · sections — Five sections in order: What it can do, Stated limits, Accessibility reach, What an MCP client carries onward, Where each claim is proven.
contract/root-readme/mcp-tool-count · root README.md · count of driver commands an MCP client gets as tools — The README states the count, which the capability-statement pin test reads; no build or doc step reads the README.

## inherited-defaults · ## Inherited Defaults
decision/driver-session-unix-socket · One local Unix-domain socket — The one local listener is a Unix-domain socket, the driver session's, carrying its lifecycle and its calls.

## existing-scopes · ## Existing Scopes
decision/no-screenshot-in-cross-os-byte-check · No screenshot step in cross-OS byte checks — A check compared byte for byte across OSes holds no `screenshot` step. · why: A shot's PNG bytes differ between linux x86_64 and macOS aarch64.
contract/escher-session-command-line/coverage · escher-session command line · coverage <app> <check>... — The coverage role lists the handlers its named kept checks left unexercised, the same boot closure called once per check.

## project-intent · ## Project Intent
overview/project-intent — escher is a fork of Blitz, a Rust library workspace for an HTML/CSS engine (high-level APIs for rendering HTML, a core DOM abstraction whose primary entry point is BaseDocument, a Document trait so wrappers around BaseDocument can all be driven by blitz-shell), being turned into an agent-first UI framework: a headless driver (CLI and MCP), stable ids for every element, a compact semantic snapshot of the screen, proven on an internal 7GUIs stand. Development is agent-driven: the framework's own driver is meant to become the harness.
