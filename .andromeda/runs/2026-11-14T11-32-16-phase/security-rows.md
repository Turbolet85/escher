## threat-model-summary · ## Threat Model Summary
decision/capability-statement-mcp-crossing · Committed statement of the MCP crossing — A committed capability statement tells its readers what an MCP client carries onward: the spawning client as the boundary with no authentication, the carried set, and onward use as the client's; it adds no carrier.
decision/coverage-check-files-untrusted · Kept check files read as untrusted — The coverage role reads each caller-named kept check as untrusted input through a bounded read and a strict parse; an unreadable, oversized, non-check or other-app file is refused malformed, holding nothing of the path or the file.
decision/driver-session-no-peer-authentication · Driver session and MCP server carry no authentication — The driver session socket and the MCP stdio server carry no handshake, token, secret or peer check, and session start does not check the answering pid; the trust boundary is the owning user or the spawning client process.
decision/driver-session-unix-socket-only · Driver session on one Unix socket — The driver session socket binds one Unix-domain socket in a caller-named state directory, never a TCP or UDP port, and exists on unix only, while an in-process session runs on linux, windows and macOS alike.
decision/mcp-result-crossing · MCP result crossing — An MCP result carries ids, accessible names, control values with a password's or file input's as the mask, the snapshot text and an acting call's diff to the client; what a client does onward, a model provider included, is the client's. · why: A boundary widening, ratified.
decision/mcp-server-stdio-only · MCP server on stdio only — The MCP server is a stdio child an MCP client spawns, speaking on the invoking user's stdin and stdout, with no listener, port or socket.
decision/mcp-stdio-no-auth · MCP server over stdio, no authentication — The driver's MCP server runs as a stdio child a client spawns under the invoking user, JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin and stdout, no listener, port or socket; the spawning client is the trust boundary, with no authentication.
decision/session-socket-carries-calls · Session socket carries calls and answers — The session socket carries the lifecycle and calls with their answers: an element id and typed text in; ids, accessible names, control values with a password's or file input's as the fixed mask, the snapshot text and the diff out; no NodeId crosses. · why: A boundary widening, ratified.
decision/snapshot-state-readings · Three state readings per control — The snapshot text and the diff hold three state readings per control, selected, pressed and invalid, as closed words and booleans. · why: Inside the ratified crossing, ratified.
contract/driver-session-reply/masked-control-values · driver session socket replies · control values — A password's or file input's control value is carried masked.
contract/driver-session-reply/no-node-id · driver session socket replies · NodeId — No reply carries a NodeId.
contract/mcp-result/masked-control-values · MCP server results · control values — A password's or file input's control value is carried masked.
decision/actions-answer-crossing · Actions answer crossing — An actions answer carries what each actionable node can take now on the socket, the command line, MCP and a kept check: ids, owner ids, keyed booleans, verb-table words and closed cause words, never a control value, typed text or NodeId. · why: A boundary widening, ratified.
decision/driver-access-by-filesystem-permissions · Driver session access by filesystem permissions — The driver session's state directory is created 0700, a present one open to its group or others is refused, and the socket is 0600, so access to the session is the owning user's.
contract/actions-answer/verbs · The actions answer · verbs — A list of entries each holding verb, a word of the verb table, and cause, a closed cause word.

## input-validation · ## Input Validation
decision/anchored-id-tier · Anchored stable-id tier — An unkeyed element's stable id is anchored under the nearest author-keyed element of its own component instance before falling back to its component path or document path. · why: The anchored tier was ratified.
decision/aria-label-trimmed-once · One trimmed aria-label read — An `aria-label` non-empty after trimming becomes the node's label and a whitespace-only one names nothing; there is one trimmed, non-empty `aria-label` read. · why: Follows accname-1.2; upstream's unfiltered read was dropped in the merge. · guard: accessibility_label
decision/aria-labelledby-outranks-label · aria-labelledby outranks label and aria-label — An element's `aria-labelledby` targets' text, gathered cycle-guarded, is its computed label, outranking a `<label>` and an `aria-label`; an id naming no element is ignored and `aria-label` is the fallback when the targets hold no text. · why: Upstream's behaviour, ratified at the upstream sync. · guard: accessibility_label
decision/aria-state-lowercase-exact-match · Control-state values matched exactly in lower case — `aria-selected`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-checked` and `aria-invalid` values are trimmed of ASCII whitespace and compared exactly, in lower case, against a closed set; an unrecognized value sets nothing, but for `aria-invalid`, which reads invalid. · why: A choice: the specification as read states no case rule and no browser was measured; the `aria-invalid` fallback is WAI-ARIA 1.2's rule. · except: A select's option reads its chosen state as selected, never `aria-selected`.
decision/boundary-widening-rule · Boundary widening rule — A new field of a closed value set inside an already ratified carrier is not a boundary widening, while a field holding authored text, an open value set, a new carrier or a new exit still is.
decision/cli-closed-argv-reader · Closed argv reader — The session command line reads argv with a closed reader with fixed rules, and checks a call before the session address is asked for.
decision/cli-echoes-nothing-typed · Command line echoes nothing typed — No command-line ending writes back anything the caller typed, and no path on argv panics.
decision/closed-driver-verb-schema · Closed driver verb schema — Every driver call is checked against a closed table of verbs and bounded argument kinds and answered with one typed command or one refusal, the first failure in a fixed order; a refused call changes nothing. · why: Each widening of the verb table is a widening of a validated surface, ratified.
decision/closed-value-field-no-widening · A closed-value field in a ratified carrier is no widening — A new field of a closed value set inside an already ratified carrier is not a widening and needs no ratification; a field holding authored text, an open value set, a new carrier or a new exit still does. · why: Ratified as the standing rule.
decision/command-schema-no-clock · Command schema reads no clock — The command schema and its validation read no clock.
decision/command-span-content-free · Command span holds no content — One command span per call holds fixed words, booleans and counts only, never a call's content, the screen text, an image or findings.
decision/control-states-closed-values-only · Control states cross as closed values — Control states leave the process only as closed enums or booleans, on the accessibility adapter and in the snapshot's words and JSON booleans, never as the attribute's text, and no unrecognized or long value is written anywhere as typed. · why: A ratified widening of the adapter crossing by a new author-derived class.
decision/driver-installs-no-subscriber · Driver installs no subscriber — The driver crate and its command line install no tracing subscriber and read no environment variable; clocks are read only by the host's idle expiry, the MCP server on a request, the session's bounded load wait, and the client's bounded stop and ready waits.
decision/driver-no-subscriber-no-env · Driver installs no subscriber and reads no env — The driver crate and its session command line install no tracing subscriber and read no environment variable.
decision/driver-outcomes-never-logged · Driver outcomes never logged — The driver crate logs and fields no command, call, argument, outcome, refusal, screen text, image, finding, session label or id record; an outcome is written only as a command-line answer, an MCP tool result, a session-socket reply or a recording file the caller asked for. · why: Outcomes leave the process only by the ratified crossing.
decision/driver-socket-closed-grammar · Driver socket closed request grammar — The driver session socket takes one request line per connection, parsed against a closed grammar under a size bound, one connection at a time under fixed bounds; anything else is refused with nothing run, and a decoded call runs through the session's one run path alone.
decision/mask-holds-on-every-carrier · Value mask holds on every carrier — A masked value stays masked on every carrier the snapshot reaches: its text form, a diff, the driver's return, the session socket and MCP tool results. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_act_filled, stand_mcp_masked
decision/masked-input-values · Password and file input values masked — A password's or file input's value reads as the fixed `MASKED_VALUE` in the snapshot, its text, diffs and every carrier, never the text, its length or a file's host path. · except: The DOM and form submission keep the value.
decision/mcp-bounded-lines · Bounded MCP requests and results — MCP request lines and results are bounded, and tool arguments are typed before validation.
decision/mcp-listing-fixed-text · MCP listing is fixed program text — The MCP tool listing's descriptions are the program's own fixed table text: each verb's help and each result field's name, kind and help. · why: Ratified as the program's own text inside the ratified carrier.
decision/mcp-no-print-or-panic · MCP server never prints or panics — The MCP server has no print, unwrap, expect or panic outside the tests.
decision/mcp-over-stdio · MCP over stdio only — The MCP server speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 on the invoking process's stdin and stdout, with no listener, port, socket, authentication or environment read. · why: The MCP carrier and its bounds were ratified as is.
decision/no-echo-of-caller-input · No echo of caller input — No command-line ending writes back anything the caller typed: no path, label, id, value or file content.
decision/no-panic-on-call-input · No panic on call-supplied input — Neither the driver command schema's validation nor the executor has unwrap, expect, panic or unreachable on anything a call supplies.
decision/no-process-handle-crosses · No process-local handle crosses with an id — Neither the stable id, the snapshot, the diff nor any driver session, answer or refusal carries a `NodeId`, `ElementId`, `ScopeId` or pointer; only the stable id text crosses.
decision/one-command-span-per-call · One command span per call — Every call handed to the session is wrapped in one INFO span named command under the escher_driver target, entered before validation so a refusal is inside it, holding fixed words, booleans and counts only.
decision/one-validation-path-for-every-carrier · One validation path for every carrier — The session socket, the command line and MCP each pass a call through the schema's validation before anything runs, and nothing public runs a command that did not come from that validation. · why: The crossing to external input surfaces was ratified with this check as the one they all pass through.
decision/password-file-value-masked · Password and file input values masked — The snapshot reads a password or file input's non-empty value as one fixed marker whatever was typed or chosen, an empty one as empty, never the text, its length or a file's host path. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_act_filled, stand_mcp_masked · except: The DOM is untouched: a file input's value attribute still holds the host path and form submission still carries it.
decision/recorded-check-strict-reader · Recorded check is read strictly as untrusted — A kept check is read as untrusted bytes, at most 1,048,576 bytes and 400 records of closed keys; anything else is refused `malformed` with no fault, holding nothing of the file, with no panic path.
decision/recorded-check-untrusted · Recorded check bytes are untrusted — A kept check is read by a strict reader bounded in bytes and records, with closed keys and schema-named arguments, anything else refused as malformed holding nothing of the file, no panic path; every replayed step is validated again; the coverage role reads checks through the same reader.
decision/replay-through-session-run · Replay runs each step through the session — A replayed check runs each kept step through the session's own validated run alone, runs nothing on a session of another app and stops at the first step whose acceptance or kept answer differs.
decision/session-label-only-caller-string · Session label is the one echoed caller string — The session label is never text read from the document and is the one caller string a reply carries.
decision/session-socket-bounds · Session socket bounds — One connection at a time; each read and write under 2 s, a client's read of an answer under 30 s, a request line at most 16,384 bytes, a lifecycle reply 128 bytes, an answer 1,048,576 bytes. · guard: an_answer_read_past_its_bound_is_a_timeout
decision/session-socket-closed-grammar · Session socket request is a closed grammar — A session socket connection carries one request line and one reply line, parsed against a closed versioned grammar with strict percent-decoding; anything outside it is refused and runs nothing, and a refusal or broken connection changes nothing.
decision/single-validation-gate · Single command validation gate — Every call, from the socket, the command line or MCP, is checked against a closed static table of verbs and bounded argument kinds, the first failure in a fixed order, and nothing public runs a command that did not come from that validation.
decision/socket-carries-screen-reading · Session socket carries what the screen reads — An answer carries what the screen reads, ids, accessible names, control values with password and file input masked, snapshot text, diff, lint findings, UI graph, never a NodeId or an attribute value as typed. · why: The crossing was ratified.
contract/cli-roles/coverage · escher-session roles · coverage — coverage <app> <check>... with no --session or --record, else usage; each check read up to 1,048,576 bytes, and an unreadable, oversized, non-check or other-app file refused malformed, status 1, holding nothing of the path or file.
contract/driver-argument-kinds/name · Driver argument kinds · name — Text of 1 to 32 bytes of a-z, 0-9 and -.
contract/driver-session-reply/state-readings · driver session socket replies · state readings — State readings are carried as closed words and booleans.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/0 · escher-session exit codes · 0 — The call was accepted: one uncoloured JSON line on stdout holds the answer, or for the coverage role its one coverage line.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/1 · escher-session exit codes · 1 — The call was refused: one uncoloured JSON line on stdout holds the refusal, or for the coverage role a malformed refusal.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/2 · escher-session exit codes · 2 — A usage error: the usage line goes to stderr and stdout stays empty.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/3 · escher-session exit codes · 3 — A session error: the session-error object on stdout and the session error's fixed message on stderr.
contract/mcp-tool-arguments/value-kinds · MCP tool arguments · value kinds — A string becomes text, an i64 a number, a bool a flag; any other value is refused malformed before anything runs, and a repeated key collapses to its last value.
contract/mcp-tool-call-span/ending · The MCP tool_call span · ending — One of accepted, refused or error.
contract/recorded-check/arguments · Recorded check file · arguments — Argument names drawn from that verb's schema.
contract/recorded-check/start-record · Recorded check file · start record — The array opens with `{"tool":"start","arguments":{"app":…}}`.
contract/session-socket-reply/refused-malformed · Session socket reply · refused malformed — A request line the grammar does not read or over 16,384 bytes; nothing runs.
contract/session-socket-reply/refused-version · Session socket reply · refused version — A known word with another wire version; nothing runs.
contract/session-socket-request/hello · Session socket request · hello — `hello v3` asks for the session's lifecycle reply.
contract/snapshot-text/clickable · Snapshot text state words · clickable — Written after `focused` only when the element's current listeners hold `click` and it is no disabled form control.
contract/snapshot-text/id-field · Snapshot text · id field — Each node's id is written as a quoted `id=` field in the string's Debug form, so the field never holds a line break or a bare `"`; the snapshot has one text form and no JSON form, Display form or parser of the text.
contract/snapshot-text/invalid · Snapshot text state words · invalid — A bare word written for an element that states it is invalid.
contract/snapshot-text/name-field · Snapshot text · name field — Each line's accessible name is written as a quoted string in the string's Debug form, so a name holding a line break or a `"` stays inside its one field.
contract/snapshot-text/pressed · Snapshot text state words · pressed — A bare word written for an element that states it is pressed.
contract/snapshot-text/selected · Snapshot text state words · selected — A bare word written for an element that states it is selected.
contract/snapshot-text/state-words · Snapshot text · state words — Control states are written as the bare words `selected` / `unselected`, `pressed` / `unpressed` and `invalid`; in JSON answers they are booleans.
contract/snapshot-text/unpressed · Snapshot text state words · unpressed — A bare word written for an element that states it is not pressed.
contract/snapshot-text/unselected · Snapshot text state words · unselected — A bare word written for an element that states it is not selected.
contract/snapshot-value/masked-value · The snapshot's value · MASKED_VALUE — Eight U+2022 characters, one fixed marker standing for a password or file input's non-empty value on every carrier.
contract/stable-element-id/stability · Stable element id · stability — A stable id is never a list index, pointer, hash, clock or process-local value, so a row reads the same id across a re-render, a remount and a second process.
decision/accessible-name-exits · Ratified exits of accessible names — Accessible names leave the process only through the platform accessibility adapter, a hosted call's answer in the snapshot text and diff JSON over the session socket and the client's stdout, and MCP tool results, and reach no log. · why: Each carrier ratified.
decision/accessible-names-not-logged · Accessible names kept out of logs — Escher's own code logs no accessible name, and a host that installs escher's sink writes none to stderr at any `RUST_LOG` level, the third-party record that carried one being dropped whole. · why: That third-party target is outside the sink's allowlist. · guard: mcp_log
decision/actions-keyed-field · Keyed flag in the actions answer — The `actions` verb's answer carries, per actionable node, its id, owner id, a `keyed` boolean and closed verb and cause words, no NodeId. · why: A ratified boundary widening.
decision/advance-moves-virtual-clock-exactly · Advance moves the virtual clock exactly — The advance verb, accepted on every session, moves the session's virtual clock by exactly the milliseconds asked inside one settled step and reports exactly that time. · why: Ratified.
decision/attribute-text-leaves-by-ratified-carriers · Attribute text leaves only by ratified carriers — Markup attribute values, names and descriptions leave escher only by the ratified carriers. · except: The page's own form submission and events.
decision/closed-pipe-drops-answer · Closed pipe drops the answer — A write to a closed stdout is dropped and the command keeps its exit status, never a panic. · guard: a_closed_stdout_drops_the_answer_and_keeps_the_ending
decision/diff-counts-only-in-logs · Only diff sizes reach a log — A diff's content never reaches a log or event, while its three sizes (counts of added, removed and changed nodes) are recorded on the driver's command span, printed at `info` or below. · why: Ratified: a diff's content never reaches a log while its three sizes may.
decision/disabled-read-by-presence · disabled read by presence on form controls — The disabled attribute is read by its presence, whatever its value, and only on a button, input, select or textarea, for focusability, pointer and keyboard activation and the snapshot's enabled and clickable readings. · why: The presence reading was ratified.
decision/id-lookup-anew-each-call · Caller-supplied id looked up anew — An acting command that takes a caller-supplied id looks it up on the screen as it reads now, on every call, never by index and keeping no node handle between calls; an id that names nothing is refused with nothing run and no panic.
decision/id-record-bounded-and-session-fed · Bounded id record fed by the session — The session keeps no node handle between calls, only a record of at most 4096 id texts fed from its own snapshots and never from a call's argument.
decision/no-node-id-between-calls · No NodeId kept between calls — No NodeId is kept between calls.
decision/per-crate-coverage-floors · Per-crate line coverage floors — The coverage leg holds three fixed line coverage floors: escher-driver 97, dioxus-native-dom 83, blitz-test-harness 90. · guard: coverage leg
decision/reached-handler-record-without-log · Reached-handler record without log or NodeId — Where recording of reached handlers is switched on, each reached handler's stable id and event name is written into a root-context record ahead of the handler's dispatch, with no log site and no `NodeId`.
decision/reached-record-deduplicated-survives-removal · Reached record deduplicated and kept past element removal — Handler coverage relies on the reached record holding the stable id and event of each node whose listeners held a dispatched event, deduplicated, so a handler whose run removes its element still counts. · why: The reached test a_handler_whose_run_removes_its_element_is_recorded_by_its_id pins it; the coverage role reads reached_handlers, each handler once
decision/recorded-type-masked · Recorded type to a masked control kept masked — A recorded type whose element resolves to a masked control or to none is kept as a stand-in marked masked, never the text, its length or a digest of it, while any other type's text is kept as it crossed. · why: Ratified.
decision/recorder-removes-only-own-files · Recorder removes only its own files — A file the recorder did not create is never removed.
decision/recording-bounds-end-recording · A failed or overlong recording ends — A failed write or a passed bound of 400 records or 1,048,576 bytes ends the recording, its check removed, the call run and not rolled back and answered `recording-failed`.
decision/recording-dir-never-named · Recording directory is never exposed — No tool call, verb, argument or result field names the recording directory, and nothing of it is logged. · why: Ratified.
decision/recording-directory-never-named · Recording directory never named or logged — No tool call, verb, argument or result field names the recording directory, and nothing of it is logged.
decision/recording-ends-on-failure · Recording ends on failure — A failed write or a passed bound ends the recording.
decision/recording-never-replaces-files · Recording never replaces or removes foreign files — A recorded check file is created 0600 with create-new under the smallest free number, rewritten whole through a temp file and rename; no file is replaced and a file the recorder did not create is never removed.
decision/screen-pixels-in-band · Screen pixels in band — A screenshot's PNG travels inside the answer itself as base64 text, on the command line and as an MCP image block. · why: Ratified as the in-band crossing.
decision/screenshot-in-band · Screenshot carried in band — A screenshot's PNG crosses in band, as base64 inside its JSON answer line or as an MCP image block, the whole screen or one element's visible part, a password input painted masked, under the unchanged answer bound. · why: The in-band image was the ratified choice, a boundary widening.
decision/session-id-record-bounded · Bounded in-process record of read ids — A session keeps a private record of ids its own snapshots read, at most 4096 ids of at most 1024 bytes each, the oldest forgotten first, read by no public item and written to no log, event, socket or file. · why: Kept to tell the stale and not-found refusals apart. · guard: the_record_holds_no_id_longer_than_a_call_can_name
decision/session-label-form · Session label form — A session label is 1 to 32 bytes of a-z, 0-9 and -, checked before the caller's boot runs; it is never document text, and is the one caller string a reply carries.
decision/session-socket-unix-only · Session socket is Unix only — The driver session socket exists on Unix only; elsewhere a session is `Unsupported`.
decision/stable-id-exits · Ratified exits of the stable id — The stable id leaves the process only through the platform accessibility adapter, the driver's answers over the session socket and the client's stdout, MCP tool results on the `mcp` role's stdout, and kept check files. · why: Each carrier ratified as a boundary widening.
decision/state-dir-path-is-parameter · Session state path is a parameter — The session state directory path is a caller parameter, never read from the environment or defaulted relative to the working directory.
decision/state-directory-path-is-parameter · State directory path is a parameter — The state directory path is a parameter, never an environment read or a working-directory-relative default.
decision/toggle-read-per-role · Toggle state read per role — `aria-checked` sets the toggle only on the five checkable roles and `aria-pressed` only on every other role; a native checkbox or radio reads neither attribute and gives its own checked state under a checkable role and nothing under any other. · why: Ratified.
contract/cli-exit-codes/0 · CLI exit codes · 0 — Accepted: the answer as one line of JSON on stdout.
contract/cli-roles/mcp · escher-session roles · mcp — mcp alone or with one --record <dir> selects the MCP role; any other word after it is usage.
contract/cli-roles/serve · escher-session roles · serve — serve <app> --session <dir> in exactly that shape, optionally with one --record <dir> after it, else usage.
contract/driver-command-span/cause · The driver command span · cause — The name of the returned refusal's cause, unrecorded until it applies.
contract/driver-command-span/verb · The driver command span · verb — The verb table's own word, never the caller's verb text.
contract/driver-session-reply/no-attribute-text · driver session socket replies · attribute text — A reply never carries an attribute's text.
contract/masked-input-value/masked-stand-in · Masked input values · MASKED_STAND_IN — A recorded masked `type` is kept as `MASKED_STAND_IN`.
contract/mcp-errors/32600 · MCP protocol errors · -32600 — invalid request, with no data: not an object with jsonrpc "2.0" and a string method, or an id of another form.
contract/mcp-errors/32601 · MCP protocol errors · -32601 — method not found, with no data: every method but initialize, ping, tools/list and tools/call.
contract/mcp-errors/32602 · MCP protocol errors · -32602 — invalid params or unknown tool, with no data: params not an object with a string name and an optional object arguments, or a name outside the verb table.
contract/mcp-errors/32700 · MCP protocol errors · -32700 — parse error, with no data: a non-UTF-8, non-JSON or overlong line.
contract/mcp-request/id · MCP requests · id — Echoed only as an i64 integer or a string of at most 128 bytes, else -32600 with id null; the one client-sent value written back.
contract/mcp-request/line-length · MCP requests · request line length — At most 65,536 bytes; a longer line is read to its terminator, dropped and answered -32700.
contract/mcp-server/protocol-error · MCP server · protocol error — A protocol error is a fixed code and message with no data.
contract/mcp-server/request-id · MCP server · request id — The admitted request id is the one client-sent value written back.
contract/mcp-server/transport · MCP server · transport — Newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 on the invoking user's stdin and stdout, with no authentication and no environment read.
contract/mcp-tool-call-span/tool · The MCP tool_call span · tool — The verb table's word for the called tool; the span parents the call's command span.
contract/mcp-tool-result/size-bound · MCP tool results · size bound — A result's text over 1,048,576 bytes is replaced by the answer-too-large result; a result holding an image is bounded by its whole written form.
contract/recorded-check/accepted · Recorded check file · accepted — One of the closed record keys, whether the call was accepted.
contract/recorded-check/answer · Recorded check file · answer — Required and a JSON object; key order is not enforced.
contract/recorded-check/digest · Recorded check file · digest — 16 lowercase hex characters.
contract/recorded-check/masked · Recorded check file · masked — True on a `type` record alone.
contract/recorded-check/masked-stand-in · A recorded check · MASKED_STAND_IN — The text "masked", with masked:true, stands for a recorded type to a masked or unresolved control.
contract/recorded-check/tool · Recorded check file · tool — One of the ten instance verbs.
contract/session-errors/state-dir-too-long · Session errors · state-dir-too-long — The state directory path is too long for a socket address; the message states the bound, 94 bytes on Linux and 90 elsewhere, holds no path, and the remedy names a shorter or relative path; status 3.
contract/session-socket-reply/ok-accepted · Session socket reply · ok v3 accepted — The call ran and was accepted; its answer JSON follows on the line.
contract/session-socket-reply/ok-oversize · Session socket reply · ok v3 oversize — The call ran but its answer is over 1,048,576 bytes.
contract/session-socket-reply/ok-refused · Session socket reply · ok v3 refused — The call was refused; the refusal JSON follows on the line.
contract/session-socket-request/call · Session socket request · call — `call v3 <verb> [<name>=<kind>:<value>]…` runs a validated verb, kinds `t` text, `n` whole number, `f` flag, verb, names and text percent-escaped.
contract/stable-element-id/anchored-path · Stable element id · anchored path — An element with no author key reads `{key}//{segment}` (then `/{segment}` per further DOM level) under the nearest keyed element of its own component instance, else its component path, else its document path; an anchor acts inside one component only.
contract/stable-element-id/author-key · Stable element id · author key — An element's HTML `id` is its author key only when it is non-empty, holds no `/` and is the first element in document pre-order to claim it; an empty, `/`-bearing or later-duplicate value gives no key and anchors nothing.
contract/stable-element-id/carriers · The stable element id · carriers — The stable element id leaves by the platform adapter, the driver's answers, MCP results and kept checks, and is written by escher's code to no log.
contract/stable-element-id/derivation · The stable element id · derivation — The HTML `id` is the author key when non-empty, `/`-free and first in document order; otherwise an anchored, component or document path is used, so no `id` can make two ids equal.
contract/stable-element-id/keyed-list-segment · Stable element id · keyed list row segment — A keyed list row's segment carries its Dioxus key as `{tag}[{key}]`; a Dioxus key that is empty or holds `/` is refused and the row reads the positional `{tag}:{n}` segment instead.
contract/stable-element-id/no-node-id · The stable element id · NodeId — No `NodeId` crosses any carrier of the stable element id.
contract/stable-element-id/virtual-node-form · Stable element id · virtual-node form — The id grammar reserves `{owner}///{key}` for a virtual node, spelled for a non-empty key with no `/`; no served id holds `///`, and the anchored path stays the only served id holding `//`.

decision/committed-counter-checks · Committed stand-Counter checks — The only committed kept checks are the two of the repository's scripted stand-Counter sessions, holding no typed text, host path, name or secret and no `screenshot` step, read only through the strict `Check::from_bytes`. · why: The one exception to a kept check's owner-only medium.
contract/kept-check-file/entry · Kept check file · entry — A check is a JSON array: the app label, then per answered call its verb, its arguments, its acceptance, a FNV-1a 64 digest of its written answer and the answer itself as answer.
decision/coverage-line-no-user-data · Coverage line carries no user data — The coverage answer line holds ids, owner ids, event names and counts only, never a control value, typed text, path or NodeId. · guard: stand_handler_coverage a_typed_sentinel_never_reaches_the_coverage_line
decision/kept-check-actions-answer · Kept check holds the actions answer — A kept actions answer holds ids, owner ids, keyed booleans, the table's verb words and closed cause words, never a control value, typed text or NodeId. · why: A boundary widening, ratified. · guard: stand_replay a_kept_actions_step_replays_and_a_changed_one_stops_naming_nodes
decision/kept-check-answer-whole · Kept check keeps each answer whole — A kept check keeps each answer as the line the driver wrote, masked as on every carrier, with a shot kept as its width and height and never its pixels. · why: Ratified, a shot's pixels excepted.
decision/kept-check-call-content · Kept check call-content class — A kept check holds call content: target ids, press keys, advance ms and text typed into unmasked controls, a masked or unresolved type's text kept as MASKED_STAND_IN. · why: Ratified.
decision/kept-check-owner-only · Kept checks are owner-only — A recorded check is written 0600 into a 0700 directory the launcher named, is never logged, and is never removed by escher but for its own check when a recording ends. · why: Ratified. · guard: recording::the_committed_checks_are_what_the_binary_records · except: Two scripted stand-Counter checks, one through the command line and one through the mcp role, are committed publicly, holding no typed text, host path, name or secret and no screenshot step.
decision/kept-checks-owner-only · Kept checks owner-only and uncommitted — A kept check stays in an owner-only medium, is never logged and is never committed. · except: The two committed checks of the repository's own scripted stand-Counter sessions.
contract/kept-check-file/contents · Kept check files · contents — A kept check holds per call its verb, arguments, acceptance, digest and masked answer, never a pixel.
contract/kept-check-file/medium · Kept check files · medium — Under `--record <dir>` or `Session::recording_into`, one `check-{n}.json` with mode `0600` per recorded session is written in a `0700` directory the launcher named.

## api-security · ## API Security
decision/host-idle-expiry · Host idle expiry — A host that has answered no request for IDLE_EXPIRY, 1,800 s, ends exactly as on stop; every answered request, refused or malformed included, restarts the count, and a connection broken before its request is whole does not. · why: The answer to the orphaned-host question: a host whose client died without stop kept running.
decision/mcp-server-over-stdio · MCP server over process stdio — The MCP server role serves the driver's verbs as tools over its own stdin and stdout only, binding no listener, port or socket, and answers only the process that spawned it, with no handshake, token, secret or peer check. · why: The crossing was ratified as is.
decision/no-wait-verb-fields · No wait argument or result on verbs — No driver verb has an argument or a result field of a wait.
decision/session-socket-sole-listener · Session socket as the one listener — The driver session's Unix-domain socket is the project's one listener, serving the session lifecycle and driver calls and their answers.
decision/time-moves-only-on-advance · Time moves only on advance — Time on a held instance moves only when a caller asks for it with advance, 1 to 60000 ms a call; no driver verb has an argument or result field of a wait, and snapshot, screenshot, lint, graph and actions wait on no load.
contract/driver-command-line/answer-bounds · Driver command line · answer bounds — A started host has 30 s to answer and each read of a call's answer is bounded at 30 s; these bound a transport and wait on no load.
contract/mcp-server/help · MCP server · help — The help tool is answered by the server itself from the schema's fixed tables, running nothing on a session.
contract/mcp-server/request-line · MCP server · request line — A request line is bounded at 65,536 bytes.
contract/mcp-server/tool-result · MCP server · tool result — A tool result is bounded at 1,048,576 bytes, one holding an image measured by its whole written form and a text-only one by its text.
contract/session-socket/lifecycle-reply · Driver session socket · lifecycle reply — A lifecycle reply is at most 128 bytes on its JSON line.
contract/session-socket/request-line · Driver session socket · request line — A request line is at most 16,384 bytes.
contract/session-wire/recording-failed · Driver session wire · ok v3 recording-failed — Wire v3 replies include the fixed reply ok v3 recording-failed.
decision/bounded-load-wait · Bounded wait on loads in flight — A harness settle never waits on a load in flight, and the driver's acting step waits on one for at most `LOAD_WAIT`. · why: So the absent request timeout cannot hang a settle or a command.
decision/load-wait-bound · Acting commands bounded by LOAD_WAIT — An acting driver command waits on a load in flight for at most LOAD_WAIT, 5 s of wall time, moving no time on the held instance, then returns the load still in flight as settled false with its busy class. · why: The absent request timeout cannot hang a command.
decision/session-host-idle-expiry · Session host idle expiry — A session host that answers no request for its idle expiry ends as on `stop`.
decision/session-socket-one-bounded-connection · One bounded connection at a time — The local session socket serves one connection at a time under fixed read, write and size bounds.
decision/settle-never-waits-on-loads · Settle never waits on a load — A harness settle reports a load in flight at once as not settled with the class Loads, waits on no clock and moves none, and its pass loop is bounded at 64 passes. · why: The absent request timeout cannot hang a settle.
contract/driver-answer/settled · Driver command answer · settled — A step that ran and did not go quiet is a result, settled false with its busy class, not a refusal; the outcome names a class only, never a URL, request, node, id, name or value.
contract/session-socket/oversize · Driver session socket · oversize — An answer is at most 1,048,576 bytes on its JSON line; over it the reply is oversize, read by the client as AnswerTooLarge.

## dependency-security · ## Dependency Security
decision/serde-json-read-only · serde_json, read only — serde_json, with no features and no preserve_order, reads the MCP server's untrusted stdin, a kept check's bytes and the driver's own answer line for replay, and writes nothing. · why: Chosen as read-only use.
decision/serde-json-untrusted-input-reader · serde_json as the untrusted input reader — serde_json, a workspace dependency with no preserve_order feature, is the reader of the MCP server's untrusted stdin, of a kept check's bytes and of the driver's answer line the replay compares.

## secret-management · ## Secret Management
decision/driver-reads-only-rust-log · Driver reads only RUST_LOG — The escher-driver library and the escher-session binary read no environment variable beyond RUST_LOG.

## error-handling · ## Error Handling
decision/closed-refusal-cause-set · Closed refusal cause set — A driver command refusal is a typed value whose cause comes from a closed set of eight, with a fault only beside `malformed`; a new verb or argument shape is refused within the set, never by adding a cause. · why: The closed set of eight was ratified.
decision/coverage-refuses-bad-checks-malformed · Coverage refuses an unusable check as malformed — The `coverage` role refuses a check file it cannot read, one past the check bound, one that is no check or a check of another app as `malformed`, holding nothing of the path or the file, and adds no cause.
decision/mcp-errors-fixed-no-data · MCP protocol errors fixed, no data — MCP protocol errors are fixed codes and fixed messages and carry no data member.
decision/refusal-closed-cause-set · Command refusal as a closed set of causes — An escher-driver command refusal is a typed value from a closed set of eight causes, each with a fixed name, meaning and remedy holding no path, and with no free-text field. · why: So a refusal cannot hold anything a call supplied. · except: A Fault is carried only beside the malformed cause.
decision/refusal-holds-no-call-input · A refusal holds nothing a call supplied — Every refusal's name, meaning and remedy is a fixed static text holding no path, and a fault carries at most the schema's own argument name, so a refusal cannot hold anything a call supplied.
decision/refusal-log-cause-name-only · Only a refusal's cause name is logged — Exactly one thing of a refusal reaches a log: its cause's fixed name, as the `cause` field of the call's driver span; no fault, meaning, remedy or display text is logged.
decision/session-error-fixed-table · Session errors from a fixed table — An escher-driver session error is written from a fixed table, holding nothing a call supplied.
decision/session-errors-fixed-table · Session errors as one fixed table — Each session error's kind, meaning and remedy is one row of a fixed table served by `help`, every text a fixed string holding no path, carried on stdout and in MCP results as the program's own text. · why: Ratified as the program's own fixed text inside the ratified carriers.
contract/cli-exit-codes/1 · escher-session CLI exit codes · 1 — The call was refused; the refusal JSON is written to stdout.
contract/cli-exit-codes/2 · escher-session CLI exit codes · 2 — Usage: the argv shape is not one the command takes; one fixed usage line on stderr, stdout empty, nothing booted and no state created.
contract/cli-exit-codes/3 · CLI exit codes · 3 — Session error: the error object with kind, message and remedy on stdout and its fixed message on stderr; a boot that fails ends with its session error.
contract/mcp-protocol-errors/invalid-params · MCP protocol errors · invalid params — A fixed code and fixed message with no `data`; only the admitted request id is written back.
contract/mcp-protocol-errors/invalid-request · MCP protocol errors · invalid request — A fixed code and fixed message with no `data`; only the admitted request id is written back.
contract/mcp-protocol-errors/method-not-found · MCP protocol errors · method not found — A fixed code and fixed message with no `data`; only the admitted request id is written back.
contract/mcp-protocol-errors/parse-error · MCP protocol errors · parse error — A fixed code and fixed message with no `data`; only the admitted request id is written back.
contract/mcp-protocol-errors/unknown-tool · MCP protocol errors · unknown tool — A fixed code and fixed message with no `data`; no reply holds the tool name.
contract/mcp-tool-result/is-error · MCP tool result · isError — A refusal or session error is a tool result `{content:[{type:"text",text}], isError: true}`, its text the same JSON as on the command line, a refused `screenshot` included.
contract/refusal-causes/malformed · Driver refusal causes · malformed — The one cause that carries a fault; a call breaking the schema, such as a `graph` or `actions` call with an argument, is refused with it and nothing runs.
contract/refusal-json/cause · Refusal JSON · cause — The refusal's cause name, inside `{"refused":{...}}`, built from the cause's fixed strings.
contract/refusal-json/fault · Refusal JSON · fault — Present only on a `malformed` refusal, naming the fault.
contract/refusal-json/meaning · Refusal JSON · meaning — The cause's fixed meaning text.
contract/refusal-json/remedy · Refusal JSON · remedy — The cause's fixed remedy text.
contract/session-error-json/kind · Session error JSON · kind — One fixed kebab-case word per session error variant, inside `{"error":{...}}`.
contract/session-error-json/message · Session error JSON · message — The error's fixed meaning, holding no path.
contract/session-error-json/remedy · Session error JSON · remedy — The error's fixed remedy text.

## logging-monitoring · ## Logging & Monitoring
decision/no-screen-content-in-logs · Screen content stays out of logs — No driver call puts screen content in a log: typed text, element ids, accessible names, a shot's image, lint findings, a part's text, a UI graph, an actions answer and a coverage check reach no log line at any level. · guard: stand_act_spans, host_log and mcp_log, read at RUST_LOG=trace under both builds
decision/session-output-holds-no-caller-input · Session output holds no caller input — No escher-session output line holds anything the caller typed. · except: The mcp role's echoed request id.
contract/command-span/cause · The command span line · cause — Recorded when the call is refused, as a closed cause word such as fonts-unavailable.
contract/command-span/line · The command span line · line — A sink-installing host writes one closed command span line per call it runs.
contract/command-span/verb · The command span line · verb — Records the instance-level verb; a graph or actions call records the verb alone, plus cause when refused.
contract/escher-session-mcp-stdout/protocol-lines · The escher-session mcp role's stdout · protocol lines — The mcp role writes JSON-RPC protocol lines only on stdout, and nothing at its end.
contract/escher-session-output/accepted-stderr · escher-session output · stderr of an accepted command — An accepted command's stderr is empty with RUST_LOG unset.
contract/escher-session-output/caller-text · escher-session output · caller-typed text — No output line echoes a caller's argument but the admitted request id the mcp role echoes; an answer carries each node's current value, so text typed into an unmasked control returns, a masked input reading only the mask.
contract/escher-session-stderr/error-messages · escher-session stderr · error messages — escher-session writes error messages on stderr.
contract/escher-session-stderr/usage-messages · escher-session stderr · usage messages — escher-session writes usage messages on stderr.
contract/escher-session-stdout/command-line · escher-session stdout · command result line — escher-session writes one uncoloured JSON line per command on stdout.
contract/escher-session-stdout/mcp-role · escher-session stdout · mcp role — The mcp role writes JSON-RPC lines only on stdout.
contract/tool-call-span/ending · The tool_call span line · ending — One of the closed words accepted, refused or error.
contract/tool-call-span/line · The tool_call span line · line — One closed line per MCP tools/call, the parent of that call's command span, holding tool and ending only.
contract/tool-call-span/tool · The tool_call span line · tool — The tool table's word for the call, a closed word outside the content-named fields; absent for an unknown tool.
decision/closed-span-lines · One sink line per closed span — The sink prints one line per closed span whose target the allowlist admits and nothing on creation, record, enter or exit; each span field is judged by the event rule, an outside-target span writes no byte, and a content-named span field's value is never stored. · why: A boundary widening of the sink, ratified as built.
contract/escher-session-output/esc-byte · escher-session output · ESC byte — No output line holds an ESC byte; output is uncoloured whatever the stream is.
