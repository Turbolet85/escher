## surface-desktop-native · ## Surface: desktop-native
decision/flight-type-select-boot-reading · Flight type select reads its two options at boot — The snapshot reads the flight booker's mode select at boot as ComboBox "Flight type" with value one-way and two ListBoxOptions, each at the select's client rect. · why: the_flight_type_select_holds_its_two_options in stand_snapshot pins role, name, value, both ListBoxOptions and their select-rect bounds in both layout modes
decision/headless-stand-pinned-viewport · Headless stand pinned viewport — The headless stand skips Home and mounts one task in TaskShell at a pinned 800 × 600, scale 1.0, Light viewport with the bundled DejaVu Sans.

decision/load-page-only-network · Load page alone has a network provider — Only the load page's boot has a network provider, an in-process stand-in answering after 200 ms from a thread of its own, so a driver click on load-fetch waits it out; every other boot keeps no network provider. · guard: stand_load_page
