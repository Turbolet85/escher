## standard-contracts · ## Standard Contracts · too large to hand whole: its other boundaries under `also here:`
decision/a11y-leg-widens-without-new-job · Accessibility leg widens in place — The a11y leg gains tests with no new job, no required status check and no workflow change. · guard: LegScriptTest.test_gate_legs_dispatch_to_cargo_and_write_their_log · r1
decision/absolute-position-ancestor-scroll-only · Absolute position subtracts only ancestors' scroll — The absolute position of a node subtracts only its ancestors' scroll offsets, so a box reads at the same position at every scroll offset of its own, and every caller reads such a box where it stands. · why: Ratified. · guard: scrolled_box_absolute_position · r1
decision/accessibility-feature-gate · Snapshot readers behind the accessibility feature — A crate taking a Dioxus crate with default features off gets the snapshot, its text, its diff and the actionable-key check only by naming the accessibility feature or depending on a crate that names it. · r1
decision/accessibility-tree-refresh-on-change · Platform accessibility tree refreshed on change — On a poll that reported work the shell drains the document's changed set, with or without the accessibility feature, and hands the adapter a fresh tree when the set was non-empty. · why: ratified as refresh, then drain — the shell half of one item with the engine's changed-set contract · r1
decision/actionable-elements-keyed · Every actionable element reads an author key — Every element an agent can act on reads an author key; unkeyed_actionable is the check that lists each actionable element whose stable id holds a /. · why: A ratified public contract addition. · guard: stand_actionable_keys · r1
decision/adapter-crossing-carries-descriptions · Adapter crossing carries descriptions — Nodes handed to the platform adapter carry descriptions, free page text, to the adapter only; the snapshot reads no description. · why: a widening by upstream merge, ratified as upstream's behaviour · r1
decision/adapter-crossing-carries-states · Adapter crossing carries states — Nodes handed to the platform adapter carry states as closed enums and booleans, never an attribute's value as typed. · why: a widening of the adapter crossing, ratified · r1
decision/advance-moves-session-clock · Advance moves the session's clock — An advance moves the session's clock by exactly the asked milliseconds on every session, and the app's own time through a caller's time step where one was handed; a session with no time step still takes advance, which moves its clock alone; advance reports the clock's move. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/advanced-ms-is-the-clock-move · advanced_ms reports the clock's move — An advance's advanced_ms is exactly the milliseconds asked, the clock's move, and its diff can be non-empty on any animated page. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/anchored-id-tier · Anchored id tier reaches one component — An author key anchors the ids of elements below it only inside its own component instance, spelled key//segment; a template root owned by another component restarts at that component's chain. · why: The anchored tier, its key//segment spelling and its one-component reach are ratified. · r1
decision/answers-written-by-own-json-writer · Answers written by the driver's own JSON writer — Every answer the driver gives has one written form, a line of JSON keyed by the schema's own words and written by the driver's own output-only writer; no serialization crate writes one, and serde_json only reads MCP requests and kept checks. · why: Ratified as serde_json for reading only. · r1
decision/aria-invalid-unknown-is-true · Unknown aria-invalid reads invalid — An aria-invalid value outside the allowed list reads as invalid true. · why: WAI-ARIA 1.2's rule for a value outside the allowed list · r1
decision/aria-state-values-exact-lowercase · ARIA state values matched exactly in lower case — ARIA state values are trimmed of ASCII whitespace and compared exactly in lower case, so an upper-case value reads unrecognized. · why: a choice: the specification as read states no case rule and no browser was measured · r1
decision/blitz-tests-single-test-target · blitz-tests manifest declares one test table — The blitz-tests package keeps test autodiscovery on and declares exactly one test table, `all`, with test set to false. · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest · r1
decision/boa-script-engine · Boa runs document scripts — A document's scripts run on Boa, JS listeners before Blitz default actions. · r1
decision/bounded-package-install · Bounded package install — Every fork CI package install goes through the one install script: up to 3 attempts, each update and install under the timeout bound BOUND=120 with the kill grace GRACE=10, pausing 10 s when another attempt remains. · guard: InstallScriptTest; test_o_package_installs_are_bounded · r1
decision/bounded-retried-package-install · Bounded, retried package install — Every CI package install goes through one bounded, retried install script; no ci.yml line calls apt-get. · r1
decision/capability-statement-matches-schema · Capability statement held to the driver schema — The capability statement and README name every verb and refusal cause and state in words the counts of verbs, refusal causes, session errors, node keys and exit statuses that the driver schema holds. · guard: CapabilityStatementTest · r1
decision/cargo-legs-locked · Cargo legs run locked — Every cargo leg of the CI leg script runs with `--locked`. · except: `fmt`, and `examples/wasm_hello`, which has no `Cargo.lock` · r1
decision/cells-grid-single-tab-stop · Cells grid is one Tab stop with arrow and Enter editing — The cells-grid is one Tab stop whose arrows move the current cell and whose Enter opens the editor, an editor Enter committing and returning focus to the grid. · why: Pinned by the stand_keyboard Cells walk and stand_cells_served, which read focus back on cells-grid after an editor Enter · r1
decision/cells-not-a-lean-task · Cells is not a lean task — The Cells task boots through its own stand entry and is kept out of the lean task set. · why: Its screen passes the snapshot text's budget and reads in parts. · r1
decision/changed-set-refresh-then-drain · Changed set, refresh then drain — A document's changed set holds every tracked write until drained, node creation marking nothing; the windowed shell drains it, and a drained id is read as possibly dropped, never by indexing. · why: ratified; the engine half of one item with the shell's refresh on change, changing behaviour for every Blitz document · r1
decision/ci-contract-pinned · CI workflow contract pinned by tests — The fork CI legs, jobs and artifacts are held by a test suite run in the ci-scripts leg. · guard: test_ci_workflows.py · r1
decision/class-atoms-synced-on-write · Class atoms kept in sync on class attribute writes — Stylo's class matching reads the element's class atoms, kept in sync on every class attribute write. · why: Stylo's has_class and each_class matching read the atoms, and every class-toggling Dioxus page writes class through the mutator · r1
decision/client-rect-under-transforms · Client rect read through transforms — The client bounding rect and client rects of an element read it where its transforms move it: the border box mapped through its own and every containing block's transform, read as the axis-aligned bounding box; with no transform on the chain the reading is the untransformed one. · why: Matches CSSOM View getBoundingClientRect; ratified. · guard: transformed_client_rect · r1
decision/cold-agent-isolated-session · Cold-agent run is one isolated session — A cold-agent run starts one isolated non-interactive Claude session from a fresh temporary directory with a fixed prompt and only the escher server's tools, under a budget and time cap. · why: ratified · guard: test_cold_agent.py · r1
decision/cold-agent-six-apps · Cold-agent prompt names six apps — The cold-agent prompt names six apps (counter, flight booker, timer, CRUD, cells and the load page) and their goals, naming no stand id. · r1
decision/cold-agent-wrong-call-bar · Cold-agent wrong-call bar — A cold-agent run passes only when wrong calls times 100 is at most 5 times the tool calls. · r1
decision/coverage-excludes-keyboard-compat · Coverage excludes the keyboard compat bridge — Both coverage measurement lines exclude dioxus-native-dom's crate-private keyboard compat module, the floors unchanged. · why: The module is upstream's temporary keyboard-types 0.7/0.8 bridge, excluded until escher takes upstream's retirement of it. · guard: test_coverage_leg_reaches_the_floor_on_each_crate · r1
decision/diff-content-never-logged · Diff content never logged — A diff's content never reaches a log or event; only its three counts of added, removed and changed may be recorded on the driver's command span. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/diff-not-engine-changed-set · Diff separate from the engine's changed set — The diff compares two snapshots and is not derived from the engine's changed set; a set changed flag beside an empty diff is a designed case. · why: The changed set is the cheap signal that something was written; the diff is what a snapshot reads differently. · r1
decision/double-click-window · Two clicks without an advance read as a double click — Two clicks on one point with no advance of at least 500 ms between them read as a double click, as the click verb's help says. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/driver-logs-no-content · Driver logs no content — Nothing in escher-driver logs an id, a name or a value. · r1
decision/each-aria-attribute-read-once · Each ARIA attribute read once — The accessibility builder reads each attribute once, keeping the trimmed aria-label and the closed-set state reads over upstream's. · why: differs from upstream, whose bool-parsed aria-selected and unfiltered aria-label reads were dropped in the merge · r1
decision/falsy-boolean-attribute-cleared · Falsy boolean attributes cleared — A falsy value of one of the 28 boolean attribute names of upstream's predicate clears the attribute on both the dynamic and the static template path; a truthy value is still written, and an unlisted attribute holding false is written as "false". · why: The project's own list of 27 names was retired for upstream's predicate, leaving the mutation writer identical to upstream's. · guard: dioxus_falsy_boolean_attrs · r1
decision/file-url-load-rule · File URLs only for file documents — A `file:` URL may be loaded only by a document whose own URL is `file:`, or as a top-level load; fetch, module imports and script sources ask before the fetcher is called and read a refusal as Forbidden, and blitz-net refuses every other engine request with FileForbidden before reading the disk. · r2
decision/font-embolden-local-witness · Local witness for font-embolden paint — The font-embolden feature is built and tested locally by the embolden step of the fast gate, with no CI job; macOS exercises the feature in CI. · why: Running the painted select-popup test under the feature on linux reproduces macOS's two readings. · guard: test_fast_leg_ends_on_the_font_embolden_witness · r1 · add-to · F1
decision/fresh-list-survives-focus-restyle · A just-opened list survives the focus restyle — A select list opened by a click is held fresh against the restyle of a :focus rule, so a rule that moves the select's box cannot close the list the click opened. · why: A click focuses and opens in one step, before the focus rule's restyle. · guard: a_focus_rule_that_moves_the_selects_box_leaves_the_list_a_click_opened · r1
decision/geometry-transform-parse-stylo · Stylo parses geometry transforms — The script geometry interfaces delegate transform parsing to the native side, which uses stylo's CSS parser. · r1
decision/graph-signal-hook-in-seven-guis · Graph signal hook lives in seven_guis — The Signal form of the graph-state hook lives in the stand application, not in the Dioxus DOM bridge. · why: dioxus-native-dom names no crate that defines Signal. · r1
decision/hand-written-answers · Driver answers written by hand — Every driver answer is written by hand in a crate-private module; no serialization crate writes one, serde_json only reading MCP requests and kept checks. · r1
decision/harness-counts-loads-at-net-provider · Harness counts loads at the net provider — A supplied non-noop net provider is wrapped in a counting provider that counts a request in flight until its handler is consumed or dropped and forwards errors; an offline harness or a wrapped document is read through its pending critical resources alone. · why: Loads are counted where every request crosses. · r1
decision/harness-reexports-key-types · Harness re-exports keyboard types — The test harness re-exports the keyboard types a key press is named with. · why: A crate depending on the harness names a key without a keyboard dependency of its own. · r1
decision/input-helpers-do-not-settle · Input helpers do not settle — Pump, tick, advance-time, dispatch and every input helper settle nothing; settling is asked for separately. · r1
decision/is-select-public-re-export · Select test public and re-exported — The engine's select test is public and re-exported so the driver can test for a select. · why: escher-driver has no blitz-dom dependency to name local_name! with; the masked-input test is the precedent · r1
decision/js-engine-boa · Boa as the JavaScript engine — Script documents run HTML with JavaScript enabled on a Boa-based engine. · r1
decision/keyed-wire-form · keyed as the actionable-key wire form — ActionableNode's keyed reading, true where the id holds no /, is the actionable-key check's first wire form, carried by the actions verb on every carrier. · r2
decision/lint-own-bounds-type · Lint's own rectangle type — Every lint rectangle is the lint's own bounds type in the snapshot bounds' space, and lint types hold no engine node id, page text, colour or value. · why: the driver crate names neither blitz-dom nor stylo · r1
decision/listener-mark-outlives-listener · Bridge listener mark outlives its listener — The bridge's event attribute stays whether a listener leaves the attribute list or turns to None. · why: Pinned by a_listener_removed_on_a_re_render_is_read_by_neither_reader, which asserts the mark stays so readers must use the vdom walk · r1
decision/listeners-read-from-vdom · Listeners read from the vdom walk — Every reader of an element's listeners reads the vdom walk's current listeners, never the bridge's listener mark. · why: The listener mark over-reports: a listener a re-render removes leaves its attribute and mark standing, and a mounted listener writes none. · r1
decision/load-page-message-hidden-until-sheet · Load button links one sheet that reveals Loaded — The load page's Load button links one stylesheet, and the Loaded paragraph stays hidden until that sheet lands. · why: Pinned by the_load_page_click_waits_out_its_load_and_shows_the_message and the_load_page_enter_waits_out_its_load_and_shows_the_message · r1
decision/masked-input-values · Password and file input values masked — A password or file input's value reads MASKED_VALUE when non-empty and empty when empty, never the text, its length or a file's host path. · r1
decision/mcp-current-revision-not-taken · Current MCP revision not taken up — The MCP server does not take up the current MCP revision; a handshake asking it is answered with the latest of the four revisions the server speaks. · why: Deferred by decision, left among the remainders. · r1
decision/measured-limits-stated-in-the-tool · Measured limits stated where an agent reads the tool — A measured limit of the driver is stated where an agent reads the tool, in the fixed help texts of the verb table, the cause texts and the node keys' help. · why: Ratified. · r1 · add-to · F2
decision/mixed-toggle-reads-unchecked · Mixed toggle reads unchecked — A checkable-role node whose toggle is mixed reads checked as Some(false). · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/multiple-removal-settles-one-option · Removing multiple settles the chosen set to one — Removing multiple from a select through the mutator settles its chosen set to one option. · why: Pinned by multiple_removed_settles_the_set_to_one_option; the Dioxus bridge removes attributes through the mutator · r1
decision/nested-scroll-written-instantly · Nested scrolling boxes are written instantly — When scrolling into view, a nested scrolling box is written at once whatever behaviour was asked, and the requested behaviour applies only to the viewport, whose offset is computed after the nested writes. · why: The document holds one scroll animation at a time. · r1
decision/no-base64-crate · No base64 crate — A screenshot's PNG base64 is written by hand in the driver, RFC 4648 §4 padded; no base64 crate is taken. · r1
decision/no-echo-of-typed-input · No echo of typed input — No driver command's ending writes back anything the caller typed. · r1
decision/no-node-id-crosses-the-socket · Calls and outcomes cross as lines, no NodeId — Across the socket a call travels as a request line and its outcome or refusal comes back as one line of JSON, and no engine NodeId is in either. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/no-script-text-selection-readers · Script text readers unused — escher uses none of the script text-selection and innerText readers. · r1
decision/no-seed-on-carriers · No seed crosses the driver's carriers — No run seed crosses the driver's carriers: no verb, argument, command-line flag, MCP tool field, kept-check key or span field carries one, so every driver session and every kept check's replay reads the default seed; a seed reaches a run only from in-process code that builds its VirtualDom. · why: A seed on a carrier would widen the session boundary; the absence is the operator's answer A to the founder's fork, standing PROVISIONAL until the founder confirms or replaces it. · provisional · r1
decision/no-snapshot-in-logs · No snapshot content in logs — No log or event carries the snapshot, its text or a diff. · except: a diff's three counts, added, removed and changed, on escher-driver's command span. · r1
decision/no-wall-time-outside-clock · No direct time reads in blitz-dom — No Instant::now() or SystemTime::now() stands in blitz-dom outside its clock module. · r1
decision/one-actionable-rule · One actionable rule — Both actionable readers read one actionable rule: focusable, an interactive role, or current listeners holding an event other than mounted. · r1
decision/one-axis-clip-readings-kept · One-axis clip readings kept as measured — A box clipped on one axis stops the hit at its whole padding box while the visible region narrows only on the clipped axis, so a driver click on a target outside along the visible axis is refused as covered; neither reader is changed. · why: Ratified to measure and record the difference rather than move either reader. · guard: stand_act_obstructed · r1
decision/one-ci-leg-runner · One CI leg runner — Every linux CI job runs its leg through one bash leg runner, the same command the dev host runs. · except: The cross-platform test matrix, its linux android entry included, runs cargo or cross directly. · r1
decision/one-disabled-reading · One shared disabled reading — Focusability, the pointer gates and the activation keys all share one reading of disabled: a button, input, select or textarea carrying a disabled attribute. · r1
decision/one-self-description-for-cli-and-mcp · One self-description for command line and MCP — The command line's help and the MCP server's help tool serve the same bytes, the program's own fixed text read from the schema's tables, reading no environment and printing nothing. · why: Ratified as the one table riding the ratified carriers. · r1
decision/one-virtual-clock · One virtual clock per harness — The harness holds one virtual clock its built documents share; only tick and advance-time move it, a negative or non-finite step moving nothing, and screenshot, text contrast and settle never move it; a wrapped document keeps its own clock. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/only-stand-repeat-frees-disk · Only stand-repeat frees disk — Only the stand-repeat CI job frees disk. · guard: test_only_stand_repeat_frees_disk · r1
decision/package-install-repair-before-retry · Repair before a package install retry — Every attempt after the first starts with a bounded `dpkg --configure -a` repair, and a failed repair fails that attempt. · why: A bound that fires inside an install can leave dpkg interrupted, which the next attempt's repair configures. · guard: InstallScriptTest · r1
decision/password-caret-placed-by-bullets · Password caret placed by bullets — A click inside a password field places the caret by the laid-out bullets, so no width of the real characters reaches the caret; a double click selects the whole value. · why: Ratified. · guard: password_caret_click · r1
decision/password-input-painted-masked · Password inputs paint masked — A password input paints a bullet per character in every document and through every renderer using blitz-paint, so two values of one length paint byte-identical frames, focused or not, with the caret and field scroll measured on the bullets. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/per-crate-coverage-floor · Per-crate coverage floor — CI holds a coverage floor per crate. · guard: coverage_floor.py · r1
decision/reached-record-before-dispatch · Reached record written before dispatch — The reached record takes each node of the dispatch chain whose current listeners hold the event before the event runs, holding no borrow across the render. · why: So a handler whose own run removes its element still counts. · r1
decision/refusal-causes-closed-at-eight · Refusal causes closed at eight — The set of refusal causes is closed at eight, each with a fixed name, meaning and remedy, and a refusal holds nothing a call supplied. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/refused-call-records-no-ids · A call validation refuses records no ids — A call the schema's validation refuses records nothing in the session's record of seen ids; every snapshot a validated call takes is recorded, on a refusal too. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/render-with-document-unborrowed · Render with the document unborrowed — The vdom renders into a mutation buffer with the document unborrowed; one borrow then replays the buffer and is dropped before mounted events flush. · why: So user code reaching the document through MountedData during a render hits no RefCell already-borrowed panic. · r1
decision/replay-hook-after-each-step · Replay calls a hook after each replayed step — Handler coverage relies on the replay calling a hook after each replayed step, so the screen can be read between steps. · why: The driver's coverage role passes a hook to replay_each that reads the screen's reached handlers between steps · r1
decision/resolve-reconciles-select-list · Resolve reconciles the select list before hover — Resolve reconciles the select list after layout and before refreshing hover, and removing a select clears its list. · why: Pinned by a_select_made_inert_disabled_hidden_or_removed_with_its_list_open_closes and a_focus_rule_that_moves_the_selects_box_leaves_the_list_a_click_opened · r1
decision/screenshot-png-in-band · Screenshot image carried in band — A screenshot's PNG crosses inside the answer line as base64, and on MCP as an image block in the tool result. · why: Ratified as the chosen fork. · r1
decision/screenshot-reads-session-clock · Screenshots read the session's clock — The overlay scrollbar fade reads the session's clock, so two screenshots of one state with no advance between them read the same pixels. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/scrolled-box-bounds · Scrolled box bounds — A scrolled box reads the rect it stands at, the same before and after its content is scrolled; only the scroll offsets of boxes above it on the containing-block chain move it. · why: Fixed on a ratified ruling. · guard: scrolled_box_client_rect · r1
decision/seen-ids-record-bounded · Session's record of seen ids bounded — Between calls a session keeps of its screens only id text, at most 4096 ids, never an id longer than a call can name, forgetting the one read longest ago past the bound; the record has no public reader and is never printed or logged. · why: Ratified for ids longer than a call can name. · guard: the_record_holds_no_id_longer_than_a_call_can_name · r1
decision/select-choice-single-write-path · Select choice has one write path — Every change of a select's chosen options goes through the one select-choice write path, which takes a set of options. · r1
decision/select-list-colours-engine-constants · Select list colours are engine constants — The open select list's highlight text, highlight background, disabled text and border colours are engine constants on the list view, not design tokens. · r1
decision/select-list-rows-and-placement · Select list shows at most 20 rows, placed where they fit — An open select list shows at most 20 rows, opens where its rows fit or on the roomier side, and a select with no row to show opens nothing. · why: Pinned by a_long_list_shows_twenty_rows_and_scrolls_by_key_and_by_wheel, a_disabled_inert_hidden_singular_or_empty_select_opens_nothing and the place unit test · r1
decision/select-tests-name-element · Select tests name the element — The select tests the driver reads name the element and never the role. · r1
decision/session-apps-one-table · Session apps from one table — The escher-session usage line's apps and the MCP start tool's enum are written from one private table. · r1
decision/session-moves-clock-not-time-step · Session, not the time step, moves the clock — A stand's time step only delivers the whole timer ticks the asked milliseconds hold, carrying the remainder across calls; the driver session, not the step, moves the harness's clock. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/settle-never-waits-on-time-or-loads · Settle never waits on loads or time — Settle drives render and layout to quiet, reports a load in flight and never waits on one, and neither waits on nor advances a source only time moves; it reads no clock but the harness's own, logs nothing and starts no thread. · r1
decision/snapshot-text-budget · Snapshot text budget — One screen's text stays under SNAPSHOT_TEXT_BUDGET, 10,000 bytes, a ceiling callers compare against and text_parts cuts within, never enforced by to_text. · why: Keeps a screen inside the agent client's documented 10,000-token warning, 25,000-token maximum and 50,000-character file threshold. · r1
decision/snapshot-text-never-logged · Snapshot text never logged — The snapshot text leaves the process only as a returned value or a hosted call's answer; no log or event carries it, and a kept check holds it only in an owner-only file never logged. · why: Ratified. · except: The two committed checks are the one exception to owner-only. · r1
decision/stale-mounted-event-skipped · Stale mounted event skipped — A mounted event queued for an element removed before the flush is skipped. · why: Differs from upstream: upstream's test for it is left out, as Dioxus 0.7 delivers one mounted event where the test asserts none. · r1
decision/stand-offline · Stand boots offline — Every stand boot is offline, with no net provider and no base URL. · guard: the_stand_options_stay_offline · except: The load page boot replaces the net provider with its own network stand-in. · r1 · add-to · F1
decision/stand-pinned-environment · Stand pins its environment — Every headless stand boot uses a pinned 800 by 600 viewport at scale 1.0 in the light colour scheme, installs no telemetry and reads no environment variable. · r1 · add-to · F1
decision/stand-typography-dejavu-sans · Stand typography is DejaVu Sans — The stand's one bundled font, DejaVu Sans, is registered for every generic family with system fonts off in every stand boot; the typography is stated in the stand contract, not on the design-system product surface. · r1 · contradict
decision/toggle-read-per-role · Toggle state read per role — aria-checked sets the toggle only on checkable roles and aria-pressed only on others, and a native checkbox or radio reads neither, its native checkedness winning. · why: ratified; native checkedness winning follows HTML-AAM · r1
decision/tool-call-span-tool-and-ending · MCP tool call span with tool and ending — Each MCP tool call leaves one span carrying only the tool's table word and its ending, the command span of a session run nested under it. · why: Ratified. · r1
decision/transformed-element-bounds · Transformed element bounds — An element under a transform reads its bounds where its transforms move it, so a driver click on a translated button is accepted and lands. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_act_transformed · r1
decision/type-replaces-control-content · Type replaces what a control holds — The type verb replaces what the target control holds, selecting all and typing over it, and an empty text clears the control; a target that reads no value is typed into as is. · why: Chosen in place of appending the text after the old value. · r1
decision/upstream-only-workflows · Upstream-only workflows — The WPT, WPT post-results and publish workflows, and the Signed Builds and WPT environments, run only on DioxusLabs/blitz; the fork builds no bundle. · r1
decision/validated-commands-only · Driver commands run only after validation — Every driver call runs through the session's one run entry, which validates first; nothing public runs a command that did not come from validation. · r1
decision/validated-verb-set-widened-by-ratification · Validated verb set widened only by ratification — The driver's validated verb set is closed; a verb joins it only as a ratified widening of that set, at the instance, session or tool level. · why: Each verb beyond the first acting verbs joined as a ratified widening of the validated verb set. · r1
decision/visibility-from-geometry-not-hit · Visibility is read from geometry, never from a hit — Whether an element can be seen is read from the visible-region geometry of its clipping chain and never from a hit test. · r1
decision/windows-entries-pass-through · Windows script entries are pass-throughs — The Windows entries of the agent-run and cold-agent pipes are pass-throughs with no logic. · r1
contract/base-document/can-paint-text · BaseDocument · can_paint_text — Public and read-only: whether the font context resolves a family for the sans-serif generic. · r1 · add-to · F3
contract/base-document/has-changes · BaseDocument · has_changes — Reads true while the changed set is non-empty, from the first tracked write until the next drain. · r1
contract/base-document/layout-as-text-input · BaseDocument · layout_as_text_input — Public and read-only: lays text out with a text input's editor styles, scale and direction in the document's fonts, one unbroken line, None for a node that is no text input. · r1
contract/base-document/select-of · BaseDocument · select_of — Public and read-only: the select a node belongs to, if any. · r1
contract/base-document/select-value · BaseDocument · select_value — Public and read-only HTML select.value: the chosen option's value, a multiple select's first chosen option in tree order, None with none chosen or for a node that is no select. · r1
contract/base-document/select-values · BaseDocument · select_values — Public and read-only: the select's chosen values. · r1
contract/base-document/take-changed-nodes · BaseDocument · take_changed_nodes — Returns the changed set and leaves it empty; a returned id may name a dropped node, so it is read through get_node. · r1
contract/basedocument-readers/text-extent · BaseDocument readers · text_extent — Returns the content box and the laid-out text extent of an inline root, or None for an unresolved id, a node that is no inline root or one with no inline layout; mutates nothing and never logs, prints or panics; RTL and vertical text read as LTR lines, a transformed box at its client rect. · r1 · add-to · F2
contract/ci-leg-legs/a11y · ci-leg.sh legs · a11y — The `a11y` leg runs fourteen named accessibility integration tests on one `cargo test --workspace --locked` line; other focus and accessibility tests stay in the `test` leg. · r1

contract/kept-check/accepted · Kept check file · accepted — Each record states whether the call was accepted. · r1
contract/kept-check/answer · Kept check file · answer — `answer` is the answer's line as the driver wrote it, inlined as its own JSON object, masked as on every carrier, kept whole except a shot's pixels: a shot keeps `{"width":…,"height":…}` with no `png`. · r1
contract/kept-check/arguments · Kept check file · arguments — A record's `arguments` are written in the verb's schema order; a call naming an argument its schema does not name, or naming one twice, is not kept. · r1
contract/kept-check/bounds · Kept check file · size bounds — A kept check holds at most 400 records and 1,048,576 bytes. · r1
contract/kept-check/digest · Kept check file · digest — `digest` is a hand-written FNV-1a 64 (offset basis 0xcbf29ce484222325, prime 0x100000001b3) over the answer's JSON line, written as 16 lowercase hex digits. · r1 · add-to · F1
contract/kept-check/kept-verbs · Kept check file · kept verbs — Only calls of the ten instance verbs are kept, `lint`, `graph` and `actions` among them with their answers whole; any other call is not kept. · r1
contract/kept-check/masked · Kept check file · masked — `masked` is written `true` on a `type` record alone; a `type` whose element resolves to a masked control or to none keeps the text `"masked"` and `masked:true`, every other `type` keeps its text as it crossed. · r1
contract/kept-check/opening-record · Kept check file · opening record — A kept check opens with the record `{"tool":"start","arguments":{"app":<label>}}`. · r1
contract/kept-check/tool · Kept check file · tool — Each answered call kept appends one record whose `tool` is the verb called. · r1
contract/lint-verb/changes-nothing · The lint verb · side effects — The lint records each node's id as a snapshot does and runs no step, settle, pump or time move, so it changes nothing. · r1
contract/lint-verb/clipped-off-screen · The lint verb · clipped and off-screen — `clipped` and `off-screen` are read against each node's clip region: its visible region cut by the padding box of every ancestor below the root whose computed `contain` includes `paint`; an open row's region takes no such cut. · r1
contract/lint-verb/contrast · The lint verb · contrast — A node with direct non-whitespace text or a text control, reported below the required ratio, exempt when disabled; a node past an element with a `mix-blend-mode` other than `normal` is read as not measured. · r1

contract/lint-verb/overlap-select-rows · The lint verb · overlap of select options and list rows — A closed select's options, read by the element and never the role, and an open list's rows and groups are skipped by `overlap` on either side; a `multiple` select's rows are linted as usual. · r1
contract/lint-verb/truncated · The lint verb · truncated — A node that is no text control whose text box does not lie inside its clip region cut by its own padding box where it clips; a node clipped or off-screen that holds text also reads `truncated`. · r1
contract/lint-verb/wire-form · The lint verb · written form — The `lint` verb answers `{"findings":[…]}` on every carrier and is recorded as a step with its answer kept whole; its `command` span records `verb` and, refused, `cause` alone. · r1
contract/lint-verb/zero-size · The lint verb · zero-size — A node with no area that holds a name, a value, an `enabled` reading, focusability or text descendants. · r1
contract/refusal-causes/covered · refusal causes · covered — Another element is hit at the point the action would land; its meaning states the closed-select option, one-axis clip and zero-size box readings. · r1
contract/refusal-causes/disabled · refusal causes · disabled — A click or type target reads enabled false; checked first of the three screen-level causes. · r1
contract/refusal-causes/fonts-unavailable · refusal causes · fonts-unavailable — The app has no font it can paint text with; screenshot and lint refuse with nothing painted or read; remedy: boot the app with a font it can decode. · r1 · add-to · F2
contract/refusal-causes/malformed · refusal causes · malformed — An argument is unnamed, repeated, missing, of another kind or out of bound, carried with its fault; returned by validation. · r1
contract/refusal-causes/not-found · refusal causes · not-found — The id names no element on the screen as it reads now and the session's record does not hold it; nothing runs. · r1
contract/refusal-causes/off-screen · refusal causes · off-screen — The element lies outside the viewport or a scrolling box's visible part, or a screenshot crop holds no pixel; remedy: bring it into view with scroll, then act again. · r1
contract/refusal-causes/stale · refusal causes · stale — The id names no element on the screen now but the session's record of read ids holds it; nothing runs. · r1
contract/refusal-causes/unknown-verb · refusal causes · unknown-verb — The verb is not in the table by exact name, or a session- or tool-level verb is handed where an instance verb is run; returned by validation. · r1
contract/screenshot-error/empty-rect · ScreenshotError · EmptyRect — Returned when the requested rectangle, clipped to the viewport, is empty. · r1
contract/screenshot-error/fonts-unavailable · ScreenshotError · FontsUnavailable — Returned with nothing painted when the document cannot paint text. · r1 · add-to · F3

contract/snapshot-text/lines · Snapshot text · lines — One line per node in pre-order, each ended by a line break, a child indented two spaces deeper than its parent; a snapshot with no roots is the empty string. · r1
contract/snapshot-text/quoting · Snapshot text · quoted strings — A quoted string is written in str's Debug form, so it never holds a line break or a bare quote. · r1
contract/snapshot-text/state-tokens · Snapshot text · state tokens — In fixed order enabled/disabled, checked/unchecked, value=, selected/unselected, pressed/unpressed, invalid, focused, clickable; absent where the model holds nothing, invalid and clickable written only when true. · r1
contract/snapshot-text/text-parts · Snapshot text · text_parts — Cuts the text into parts of consecutive whole lines within budget bytes, a longer line a part alone, an empty snapshot one empty part; the parts concatenated equal to_text. · r1 · add-to · F1
contract/snapshot-text/to-text · Snapshot text · to_text — The snapshot's one text form, a pure function of the Snapshot with no Display impl, no second entry point, no parser and no JSON form; it never truncates or pages. · r1 · add-to · F1

## infrastructure-patterns · ## Infrastructure Patterns
decision/browser-load-aborts-previous · A browser document load aborts the previous load — Each browser document load aborts the previous one, as reload and drop do. · why: The browser's tab navigation calls load_document and the toolbar reload calls reload, so a superseded page's fetches stop; DocumentLoader's Drop aborts too · r1
decision/bundle-build-jobs · Two build jobs for browser bundles — Browser bundle builds run with two cargo build jobs. · why: to debug possible OOM · r1
decision/capabilities-doc-beside-upstream · Capability statement beside upstream docs — escher's capability statement sits in a file of its own under docs, beside upstream's three files. · why: an upstream change under docs never conflicts with it · r1
decision/cargo-deny-advisory-gate · cargo-deny advisory gate — A cargo-deny advisory gate, configured by the root deny.toml, holds the dependencies. · r1
decision/ci-cache-save-refs · CI cache save refs — ci.yml caches save only on main and build/* refs; publish-browser's and wpt's caches save only on main. · r1
decision/ci-concurrency · Per-ref CI concurrency — CI runs with per-ref concurrency and cancels a run in progress. · r1
decision/ci-failure-logs · CI logs uploaded on failure — Every leg job uploads its own log on failure, kept 7 days, and the coverage job also uploads its report on success, kept 7 days. · r1
decision/ci-fast-slow-split · CI fast/slow split — fmt, clippy, test-features-default and ci-scripts carry no needs, and every other CI job, the matrix included, needs all four. · r1
decision/ci-read-only-permissions · Read-only CI permissions — CI runs under a workflow-level contents: read permission with no job-level grant. · r1
decision/fmt-clippy-gates · fmt and clippy gates — CI gates every change on rustfmt and clippy. · r1
decision/js-entry-redraws-and-arms-timer · JS entry points request a redraw and arm the timer thread — Each JS entry point requests a redraw and re-arms the timer thread that wakes the event loop at the next JS timer deadline. · why: The windowed shell repaints after script work and wakes for due JS timers only through this; the WPT runner opts out with without_timer_thread · r1
decision/linux-tested-by-fast-leg · Linux tested by the fast leg — Linux is tested by the fast test leg, not the matrix; the matrix tests windows and macos and only builds ios and android. · r1
decision/locked-cargo-legs · Locked cargo legs — Every cargo leg of CI runs with --locked. · except: fmt, and examples/wasm_hello. · r1 · stale
decision/net-launch-enters-tokio-runtime · Net launch enters a tokio multi-thread runtime — Launch paths built with `net` off wasm32 enter a tokio multi-thread runtime before the event loop runs. · why: blitz-net's Provider spawns every fetch with tokio::spawn, so dioxus-native and blitz launches with net need the entered runtime for loads to run · r1
decision/nextest-mutants-profile · nextest mutants profile — cargo-nextest carries one profile, mutants, for the mutation tier; the default profile stays untouched. · r1
decision/nix-flake · Nix flake — A Nix flake exposes the browser package as default and a blitz-dev devShell, wrapping Linux packages so the dlopen'd graphics and windowing libraries are found. · r1
decision/objc2-encoding-assertions-off · objc2 encoding assertions disabled — blitz-dom depends on objc2 with disable-encoding-assertions on Apple targets. · why: a hack to stop debug builds panicking · r1
decision/pinned-actions · SHA-pinned actions — Every uses: of every workflow is pinned to a 40-hex commit SHA, its ref kept as a trailing comment, and every rust-toolchain step names its toolchain. · guard: test_ci_workflows.py · r2
decision/rustdoc-warnings-gate · Workspace rustdoc warnings gate — Rustdoc warnings are errors, and the docs job documents every workspace library crate under that setting, with no output-filename collision. · except: the browser binary blitz is not documented, so the lib blitz alone writes its docs · r1
decision/shell-polls-after-window-event · Shell polls its window after each window event — Every shell window event is followed by a Poll. · why: DioxusNativeApplication forwards window events to the shell and runs the vdom work handlers scheduled in the Poll that follows (CloseRequested excepted) · r1
decision/sites-outside-workspace · sites outside the workspace — The sites directory is excluded from the Cargo workspace. · r1
decision/stand-uses-bundled-font · Stand shares the bundled font — seven_guis' bundled DejaVuSans bytes compile on native too, where the headless stand registers the same font. · r1
decision/unrewritten-profiles · Build profiles unrewritten — CI jobs build the profiles unrewritten, with no opt-level rewrite step. · r1
decision/workspace-shared-dependencies · Shared workspace dependencies — The Cargo workspace declares its dependencies once in a shared workspace dependency table. · r1
decision/wpt-test-reset-and-panic-catch · WPT runner resets the net provider and catches test panics — The WPT runner resets the net provider before each test and runs each test inside a panic catch, a panic yielding Unknown or Crash. · why: The WPT run's per-test isolation and its CRASH count in the summary and wpt report depend on the reset and the caught panic mapped to Unknown kind and Crash status · r1
