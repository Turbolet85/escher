## 2026-10-05-ci-gate-legs — a named a11y leg on fork CI
**Section:** §3 A11y Assertion Harness Contract (CI integration · `a11y-ci-gate-wire`) · §9 CI Integration
**Change:** was "accessibility checks in CI are observed absent" (§3, §9) and `a11y-ci-gate-wire` recorded absent; now ci.yml's `a11y` job, "Accessibility (a11y) tests", runs `bash .github/scripts/ci-leg.sh a11y` — `cargo test --workspace --locked --test accessibility_hidden --test accessibility_roles --test focusability_updates`, 6 + 6 + 3 tests — in the slow tier behind the four fast jobs, restoring the test job's cache and saving none; it runs existing tests and adds no stand assertion; the §9 search `a11y|accessib|axe` over the workflows finds it; the key reads discharged.
**Why:** the CI gate legs chunk wired the existing accessibility tests into fork CI as their own leg; SC assertions on stand controls gating merges stay with the "Stand a11y assertions" work.
