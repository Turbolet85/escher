## 2026-10-05-ci-gate-legs — a coverage-report artifact beside the per-leg failure logs
**Section:** §9 CI Integration (Telemetry artifact handling) · every section citing `ci.yml` or `ci-leg.sh` lines
**Change:**
- §9 gains a row: the `coverage` leg's lcov file `target/coverage/lcov.info` — line counts of the workspace's public source, no user data — uploaded only on success as artifact `coverage-report` from `target/coverage/`, kept 7 days, the one fork-CI artifact outside `target/ci-logs/`. The per-leg failure-log row stands, confined to `target/ci-logs/`; the confinement rationale of "2026-10-05-fork-ci-reached — per-leg CI failure logs; WPT and publish telemetry upstream-only" now holds for the failure logs only;
- 3 citations re-pointed by a measured line map; no claim text changed by the re-point.
**Why:** test-plan §3 `coverage-tooling-install` — a coverage report kept with the run. A boundary widening (a new upload out of fork CI), recorded PROVISIONAL: delegate overseer, 2026-10-05, under the founder's standing delegation of technical decisions (relayed verbatim by overseer) — basis: public OSS line counts, no secret, the repository's own Actions store, 7-day retention; the founder's own later word supersedes it.
