decision/accessibility-reach-tier-0 · Accessibility reach at tier 0 — The published accessibility reach is tier 0: WCAG SC 2.1.1, 1.4.3 and 2.4.3 and no other criterion, with what an assistive technology reads unmeasured.

contract/keyboard-activation/enter · keyboard activation · Enter — A pressed Enter on the focused node dispatches a Click when the node is no disabled form control and is a button, a summary, an input of type submit, reset or button, or an a with href.
contract/keyboard-activation/space · keyboard activation · Space — A released Space dispatches a Click for a summary, or for a button or an input of type submit, reset, button, checkbox or radio that is no disabled form control, never for a link.

decision/click-focuses-buttons · A click focuses a button — A pointer click on a button of any type or an input of type submit, reset or button focuses it, submits the form owner when it is a submit button and ends the walk, in every document; a click on any other non-interactive element still clears focus. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_keyboard; stand_act_obstructed
decision/keyboard-activation-enter-space · Enter and Space activate as a click — A pressed Enter on a focused enabled button, summary, submit/reset/button input or link with href, and a released Space on a focused enabled button, summary, or submit/reset/button/checkbox/radio input, dispatch a synthetic Click that runs the app's handlers and then the default click action. · why: ratified; a disabled form control takes neither key · guard: stand_keyboard, stand_act_keys · except: A disabled attribute on a summary or a link gates neither key, as HTML does; a link takes no Space.

## 1-a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin a11y-scope-summary
> NOT YET MEASURED — must-be-accessible critical paths and a11y triggers: no slice recorded them, and s03 recorded accessibility scope as out of slice.
absence/assistive-technology-reach — A platform accessibility adapter in any stand binary, so no active assistive technology is given a tree

## 2-a11y-strategy · ## 2. A11y Strategy · twin a11y-strategy
> NOT YET MEASURED — a stated accessibility strategy (POUR coverage depth, agent-runnable invariants, naming conventions): no slice states one, and s01, s02, s03, s06, s07, s08, s10 and s13 recorded accessibility strategy as out of slice.

## 3-a11y-assertion-harness-contract · ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
> NOT YET MEASURED — the structured violation JSON schema / log format, the WCAG criteria mapping of the existing tests and a screen-reader test pattern: no slice recorded them (s01, s02, s06, s07 and s13 recorded the a11y assertion harness as out of slice). The obs log format is now measured for escher's own sink (obs plan §3, §6 Log Coverage, §8): non-JSON text lines on stderr in two record classes — one line per printed event, `{RFC 3339 UTC time} {LEVEL} {target} service.name=… service.version=… {field}={value}…`, and, since 2026-10-07-driver-command-spans, one line per closed span of an admitted target, the same prefix then `span={the span's name}`, the span's recorded fields and the layer's close fields `message`, `time.busy` and `time.idle`, with no line when a span is created, recorded to, entered or exited (the second class was ratified by the founder, 2026-10-09, as obs plan §6 states) — both behind a target allowlist that, among others, prints only `node_id` / `status` / `waiting_nodes` / `property` / `log.*` fields for `blitz*` and `accesskit_xplat` targets, redacts `text`, `value`, `html` and `attrs` for escher's own targets (`escher_*`) and drops a record from any other target whole, at every level — a closed span's every pair judged by the same rule, an outside target's span writing nothing; an a11y violation schema is not yet defined against it.

## 5-keyboard-navigation · ## 5. Keyboard Navigation · twin keyboard-navigation
> NOT YET MEASURED — skip links, modal focus traps and route-change focus restoration: no slice recorded them; s01 recorded keyboard focus handling code as out of slice and s13 recorded keyboard interaction as out of slice.

## 6-visual-design-verification · ## 6. Visual Design Verification · twin visual-design-verification
> NOT YET MEASURED — focus-ring, target-size and typography-readability tokens: no slice recorded them, and s01 and s07 recorded contrast and visual checks as out of slice. The stand controls' contrast pairs are measured since 2026-10-13-stand-contrast-harness (Color contrast above), and the CRUD list rows, the text outside the controls and the colour states reached by input, hover and active included, since 2026-10-14-stand-a11y-assertions.

> NOT YET MEASURED — live regions, heading-hierarchy handling and per-surface screen-reader test specs: no slice recorded them; s01, s07, s10 and s13 recorded screen-reader handling as out of slice, and s08 recorded the screen-reader tree output as out of slice.
