  decision/headless-stand-no-sink · Headless stand runs with no sink — A headless boot made in process installs no telemetry subscriber and reads no environment variable; a headless boot made by the escher-session binary runs under that binary's sink. · except: The MCP tools check installs its own in-process recording subscriber, and the command-span check's two re-run children install escher's sink over an in-memory capture.
