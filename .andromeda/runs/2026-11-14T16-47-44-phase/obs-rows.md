decision/checks-silent · Silent checks and shared modules — Checks, their shared modules and the stand-ins they use install no subscriber, read no environment variable and print nothing, their readings going into assertions only, and the code they pin adds no log site, span, field or env read. · except: Checks whose subject is telemetry install escher's sink, the MCP tools check its own recorder, the paint-tree bench reads one opt-in env var, and a re-run child prints ids or digests its parent reads.

decision/no-file-loads-from-non-file-documents · No file: loads from non-file: documents — A file: load asked by a non-file: document is refused as a typed forbidden error: a script fetch rejects with a TypeError, a module import fails, a script element's source is recorded as a script error, and an engine sub-resource fetch fails with fixed text naming no URL or path, adding no log site.

overview/telemetry-strategy — Telemetry is the tracing crate's event macros and, in escher-driver, two hand-built spans, command and tool_call. In the engine and upstream crates tracing is compiled in only with the tracing cargo feature. escher-telemetry takes tracing with no feature and always compiles its startup and panic events into the two native binaries, seven_guis_native and escher-session. escher-driver takes tracing ungated, so its spans are written in escher-session through its host, mcp and coverage roles, and by no code path in the windowed seven_guis_native.

absence/metrics-export — Metrics exporters and metric emission (counters, gauges, histograms)
overview/5-metric-coverage — In-process timings and counters are printed, shown in the browser's in-app FPS overlay or held in process: the frame and phase timings behind the log-times features, blitz-dom's resolve phases, debug_timer, blitz-paint's layer counters, the bench, screenshot and multi_doc examples and the WPT runner's figures; the WPT scores are published to Pages on upstream DioxusLabs/blitz only.
