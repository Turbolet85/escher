- S1 · A new integration test lives in blitz-tests, one test target per file, one behavior per file, its fixtures stated once with relative asset URLs. · conventions
  decision/blitz-tests-one-target-per-file · One test target per file in blitz-tests — blitz-tests keeps one test target per file. · except: upstream's tests/all.rs, declared and held at test = false.
  decision/blitz-tests-single-test-target · blitz-tests manifest declares one test table — The blitz-tests package keeps test autodiscovery on and declares exactly one test table, `all`, with test set to false. · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest
  decision/blitz-tests-target-per-file · One blitz-tests target per file — blitz-tests keeps one test target per file directly under `tests/`, setting no `autotests`; upstream's single-binary `tests/all.rs`, the manifest's one `[[test]]` table, is held at `test = false`. · why: Ratified; a standing two-line difference from upstream's manifest. · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest
  decision/fixture-relative-asset-urls · Relative asset URLs in fixtures — HTML fixtures reference sibling assets with ./-relative URLs.
  decision/fixtures-test-module · Shared fixtures test module — A `fixtures` test module, read by `mod fixtures;`, states once the fixture boot and hold, the fixture pages more than one check reads and the held network stand-in `HeldNet`; a page with one reader stays in its check's file.
  decision/integration-test-one-behavior · One behavior per integration test file — Each integration test file covers one behavior and opens with a `//!` doc naming the behavior and any guarded bug.
  decision/integration-tests-in-blitz-tests · Integration tests live in blitz-tests — Integration tests live in the tests directory of the blitz-tests crate.
  decision/relative-fixture-urls · Relative URLs between fixtures — Fixtures reference sibling assets with `./`-relative URLs.
  decision/shared-fixtures-stated-once · Shared blitz-tests fixtures stated once — The blitz-tests fixture module states the fixture boot and hold, the shared fixture pages and the held network stand-in once.
  decision/single-reader-page-stays-local · Single-reader fixture page stays local — A fixture page with one reader stays in its check's file.
- S2 · A scenario where a document is laid out runs in both layout modes. · conventions
- S3 · A new test asserts its fixture's precondition first and carries a descriptive name. · conventions
  decision/descriptive-test-names · Descriptive test names — Tests carry descriptive snake_case names.
  decision/fixture-precondition-first · Assert the fixture's condition first — Tests first assert the fixture produces the condition under test.
  decision/tests-assert-fixture-first · Tests assert the fixture first — A test first asserts that its fixture produces the condition under test.
- S4 · Unit tests sit at the end of their source file. · conventions
  decision/driver-unit-tests-in-path-children · Driver unit tests in path children — An escher-driver module holds its unit tests in a #[path] child file of its own, never a module of the crate's public tree.
  decision/unit-test-placement · Unit-test placement — Unit tests sit in a test module at the end of the source file, or in a child file of their own.
  decision/unit-tests-at-file-end · Unit tests at the end of the source file — Unit tests sit in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the end of the source file. · except: Eight unit-test modules sit in files of their own, each a `#[cfg(test)]` child declared through `#[path]` at its parent.
- S5 · New public items and modules carry docs, cite the spec URL where they implement one, and justify any unwrap or expect. · conventions
  decision/cite-the-spec · Behave like a browser, and cite the spec — Web semantics are written against named specifications and named browser engines.
  decision/justified-expect-unwrap · expect and unwrap need a justification — An allow of `clippy::expect_used` or `clippy::unwrap_used` stands next to a justification. · except: The browser app's test module allows `clippy::expect_used` with no justification beside it.
  decision/module-and-item-docs · Module and item documentation — Modules, files and examples open with `//!` docs, examples describing what they demonstrate, and public items carry `///`. · except: The driver crate opens every file with `//!`; upstream engine modules and examples largely open without it, and some upstream public items carry no `///`.
  decision/module-docs · Module and file docs — Modules and files open with `//!` docs. · except: The driver crate opens every file with `//!`; upstream engine modules largely open without it.
  decision/public-item-docs · Public item docs — Public items carry `///` docs. · except: Some upstream public items carry no `///`, a node's tree accessor among them.
  decision/spec-url-citations · Spec URLs cited at implementations — Spec URLs are cited above or next to implementations.
  decision/unwrap-expect-justified · Justified unwrap and expect — `clippy::expect_used` and `clippy::unwrap_used` are allowed only locally, next to a justification.
