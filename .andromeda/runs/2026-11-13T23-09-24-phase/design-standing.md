  decision/tests-built-with-system-fonts · Tests built with system fonts — The blitz-tests crate builds `blitz-dom` with the `system-fonts` feature, which is also enabled by default when testing the whole workspace. · why: Without system fonts text measures 0x0 and font-dependent assertions pass vacuously.
