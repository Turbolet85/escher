## 3-observability-harness-contract · ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/checks-silent · Silent checks and shared modules — Checks, their shared modules and the stand-ins they use install no subscriber, read no environment variable and print nothing, their readings going into assertions only, and the code they pin adds no log site, span, field or env read. · except: Checks whose subject is telemetry install escher's sink, the MCP tools check its own recorder, the paint-tree bench reads one opt-in env var, and a re-run child prints ids its parent reads.

## 6-log-coverage · ## 6. Log Coverage · twin log-coverage
decision/sink-target-allowlist · Sink target allowlist — escher's sink applies an allowlist of targets in its formatter: an engine target prints only the safe fields, the rest [redacted]; an escher_ target prints every field but the content-named set; any other target is dropped whole, not an empty line, at every level and whatever RUST_LOG names. · why: The accepted cost is that a third-party WARN or ERROR never reaches stderr, at any setting. · guard: telemetry_drop · except: The upstream apps' fmt::init() stdout subscribers and the WPT runner's env_logger stay unscrubbed.
contract/escher-log-line/scrub · escher's sink log line · field scrub — Every field of an event line and every pair of a span line passes the sink's scrub.
contract/escher-log-line/bridged-log-record · escher's sink log line · bridged log record — A bridged log record is printed under its log.target, that field itself omitted, and is judged against the allowlist by its log.target.

## 7-error-capture-reporting · ## 7. Error Capture & Reporting · twin error-capture-reporting
decision/failed-stylesheet-leaves-pending-set · Failed stylesheet leaves the pending critical set — A failed stylesheet fetch drops its request from the pending critical resources, so loading does not wait on it. · why: render_blocking_stylesheet's failed_stylesheet_unblocks_rendering pins it, and the harness settle and paint_scene both read the pending critical resources
decision/no-file-loads-from-non-file-documents · No file: loads from non-file: documents — A file: load asked by a non-file: document is refused as a typed forbidden fetch error: a script fetch rejects with a TypeError, a module import fails, and a script element's source is skipped and recorded as a script error.

## error-capture-reporting · ## 7. Error Capture & Reporting · twin 7-error-capture-reporting
contract/telemetry-scrub-set/error · escher-telemetry's scrub set · error — An `error` field is in the scrub set, so the sink prints its value as `[redacted]`; a failed fetch's error text reaches no carrier beyond its log line.
contract/telemetry-scrub-set/url · escher-telemetry's scrub set · url — A `url` field is in the scrub set, so the sink prints its value as `[redacted]`.

## pii-scrubbing-compliance · ## 8. PII Scrubbing & Compliance · twin 8-pii-scrubbing-compliance
decision/engine-target-safe-fields · Engine targets print safe fields only — Under an engine target (blitz, dioxus_native, stylo_taffy, accesskit_xplat, debug_timer, js_console) the sink prints only node_id, status, waiting_nodes, property, log.module_path, log.file and log.line, every other field as {name}=[redacted].

overview/telemetry-strategy — Telemetry is the tracing crate's event macros and, in escher-driver, two hand-built spans, command and tool_call. In the engine and upstream crates tracing is compiled in only with the tracing cargo feature. escher-telemetry takes tracing with no feature and always compiles its startup and panic events into the two native binaries, seven_guis_native and escher-session. escher-driver takes tracing ungated, so its spans are written in escher-session through its host, mcp and coverage roles, and by no code path in the windowed seven_guis_native.

overview/5-metric-coverage — In-process timings and counters are printed, shown in the browser's in-app FPS overlay or held in process: the frame and phase timings behind the log-times features, blitz-dom's resolve phases, debug_timer, blitz-paint's layer counters, the bench, screenshot and multi_doc examples and the WPT runner's figures; the WPT scores are published to Pages on upstream DioxusLabs/blitz only.
