## 2026-10-06-headless-stand — disabled keyed two ways; Dioxus falsy disabled cleared; flight-booker cue checked
**Section:** §5 Keyboard Navigation → Focus order per layout (engine) · Script and framework exposure · §8 Cognitive Accessibility → Error recovery
**Change:**
- Focus order: was "focusable if it is not disabled"; now "if its `disabled` attribute does not parse as `true`", and a new bullet: the DISABLED/ENABLED state (`:disabled`) and the click target key on presence, focusability on the parsed bool — `disabled="false"` matches `:disabled` yet stays focusable, a bare `disabled=""` is focusable too.
- Framework exposure: dioxus-native-dom removes a falsy `disabled` / `checked`; its other boolean attributes are still written as `"false"` — for `hidden` that would drop a `hidden: false` node from the tree: recorded, not established.
- Error recovery: the stand check asserts the invalid-date cue without colour (`invalid` class, `disabled` Book it did not carry before); no test asserts a Dioxus control's focusability or Tab order.
**Why:** the headless stand chunk measured `disabled="false"` matching `:disabled` on enabled stand buttons and fixed the Dioxus write (widening on the delegate overseer's word, 2026-10-06, PROVISIONAL). Trap: the focusability path never had the defect — only state, styling and click targeting did.
