## 2026-10-06-telemetry-bootstrap — obs log format no longer unmeasured
**Section:** §3 A11y Assertion Harness Contract (NOT YET MEASURED marker) · every section citing `Cargo.toml` or `tests/blitz-tests/Cargo.toml` lines
**Change:**
- Was "the test plan (§3) and obs plan (§3, §6) leave the log format unmeasured"; now the obs log format is measured for escher's own sink: one non-JSON text line per event on stderr behind the allowlist scrub, which prints only `node_id` / `status` / `waiting_nodes` / `property` / `log.*` for `blitz*` and `accesskit_xplat` targets and redacts `text`, `value`, `html`, `attrs` at any target.
- The structured a11y violation schema, the WCAG mapping and a screen-reader test pattern stay unmeasured; no violation schema is yet defined against that line.
- 4 `file:line` citations re-pointed by the chunk's measured line shifts.
**Why:** the telemetry bootstrap chunk fixed the format the a11y↔obs schema bind reads.
