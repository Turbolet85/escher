# arch · standing conventions

- S1 · Each new test asserts its fixture's condition first, carries a descriptive name, and an integration test file holds one behaviour · conventions
  decision/descriptive-test-names · Descriptive test names — Tests carry descriptive snake_case names.
  decision/fixture-precondition-first · Assert the fixture's condition first — Tests first assert the fixture produces the condition under test.
  decision/integration-test-one-behavior · One behavior per integration test file — Each integration test file covers one behavior and opens with a `//!` doc naming the behavior and any guarded bug.
  decision/shared-test-modules · Shared test modules in subdirectories — The seven_guis stand checks state the tables and helpers they share once, in a `common` module read by `mod common;`, and the checks that hold a `Session` keep theirs in a second such module, `session_common`. · why: A module in a subdirectory of the integration-test directory is no test target, so each test-target file still covers one behavior.
  decision/tests-assert-fixture-first · Tests assert the fixture first — A test first asserts that its fixture produces the condition under test.
- S2 · Each new scenario test runs in both layout modes · conventions
- S3 · Each new fixture states its cases numbered, is stated once in the shared fixtures module, and uses relative URLs · conventions
  decision/feature-fixture-numbered-cases · Numbered cases in feature fixtures — Feature HTML fixtures group numbered cases under h2/h3 headings with a CSS comment per case.
  decision/fixture-relative-asset-urls · Relative asset URLs in fixtures — HTML fixtures reference sibling assets with ./-relative URLs.
  decision/numbered-fixture-cases · Numbered fixture cases — Feature fixtures group numbered cases under h2/h3 headings, with a CSS comment per case.
  decision/relative-fixture-urls · Relative URLs between fixtures — Fixtures reference sibling assets with `./`-relative URLs.
  decision/single-reader-page-stays-local · Single-reader fixture page stays local — A fixture page with one reader stays in its check's file.
- S4 · Each new unit-test module sits in the source file's path child, at the file's end, keeping its test paths · conventions · existing-scopes
  decision/driver-unit-tests-in-path-children · Driver unit tests in path children — An escher-driver module holds its unit tests in a #[path] child file of its own, never a module of the crate's public tree.
  decision/moved-unit-tests-keep-paths · Moved unit-test modules keep their test paths — Unit-test modules moved to files of their own keep their test paths.
  decision/split-test-module-as-child · Split test modules stay children of their module — A unit-test module in a file of its own is declared through `#[path]` as a `#[cfg(test)]` child of the module under test, moved out whole with its test paths unchanged. · why: As a child it reaches the module's private fields with no constructor, `pub` or `cfg(test)` shim added.
  decision/unit-test-placement · Unit-test placement — Unit tests sit in a test module at the end of the source file, or in a child file of their own.
  decision/unit-tests-at-file-end · Unit tests at the end of the source file — Unit tests sit in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the end of the source file. · except: Eight unit-test modules sit in files of their own, each a `#[cfg(test)]` child declared through `#[path]` at its parent.
- S5 · Each new expect or unwrap carries a justification; new error types are enums and fallible APIs return typed results · conventions · cross-cutting-patterns
  decision/justified-expect-unwrap · expect and unwrap need a justification — An allow of `clippy::expect_used` or `clippy::unwrap_used` stands next to a justification. · except: The browser app's test module allows `clippy::expect_used` with no justification beside it.
  decision/unwrap-expect-justified · Justified unwrap and expect — `clippy::expect_used` and `clippy::unwrap_used` are allowed only locally, next to a justification.
- S6 · Each new public item and module carries docs, with rustdoc warnings as errors · conventions
  contract/ci-leg-legs/doc · ci-leg.sh legs · doc — The `doc` leg runs `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`.
  decision/ci-quality-gates · CI quality gates — Every change passes cargo fmt, clippy with warnings denied, rustdoc with warnings denied over every workspace library crate, a cargo-deny audit of advisories and licences, per-crate coverage floors and a zero-failure stand-repeat budget. · guard: the CI legs of .github/scripts/ci-leg.sh
  decision/module-and-item-docs · Module and item documentation — Modules, files and examples open with `//!` docs, examples describing what they demonstrate, and public items carry `///`. · except: The driver crate opens every file with `//!`; upstream engine modules and examples largely open without it, and some upstream public items carry no `///`.
  decision/module-docs · Module and file docs — Modules and files open with `//!` docs. · except: The driver crate opens every file with `//!`; upstream engine modules largely open without it.
  decision/public-item-docs · Public item docs — Public items carry `///` docs. · except: Some upstream public items carry no `///`, a node's tree accessor among them.
  decision/rustdoc-warnings-are-errors · Rustdoc warnings are errors — Rustdoc warnings are errors workflow-wide, over every library crate.
  decision/rustdoc-warnings-denied · Rustdoc warnings are errors — Rustdoc warnings are errors over every workspace library crate.
  decision/rustdoc-warnings-gate · Workspace rustdoc warnings gate — Rustdoc warnings are errors, and the docs job documents every workspace library crate under that setting, with no output-filename collision. · except: the browser binary blitz is not documented, so the lib blitz alone writes its docs
- S7 · Each new driver span is built by hand and holds no content; the driver library stays without side channels · conventions · standard-contracts
- S8 · Each new cross-OS check holds no screenshot step and reads the same on every CI OS · existing-scopes · standard-contracts
- S9 · Each new driver test keeps its crate above the per-crate line coverage floor · standard-contracts
  contract/ci-leg-legs/coverage · ci-leg.sh legs · coverage — The `coverage` leg runs `cargo llvm-cov` to an lcov file and its per-file report, then the coverage-floor script, and exits with the floor's status.
  contract/coverage-floor-exit-codes/0 · coverage_floor.py exit codes · 0 — Every crate is at or above its floor, printed as `coverage floor: N of N crates at or above their floors`.
  contract/coverage-floor-exit-codes/1 · coverage_floor.py exit codes · 1 — Some crates are under their floors, printed as `coverage floor: K of N crates under their floors`.
  decision/coverage-excludes-keyboard-compat · Coverage excludes the keyboard compat bridge — Both coverage measurement lines exclude dioxus-native-dom's crate-private keyboard compat module, the floors unchanged. · why: The module is upstream's temporary keyboard-types 0.7/0.8 bridge, excluded until escher takes upstream's retirement of it. · guard: test_coverage_leg_reaches_the_floor_on_each_crate
  decision/coverage-floors · Per-crate coverage floors — A cargo-llvm-cov coverage report is gated by per-crate floors: CI fails when line coverage falls under 97 % for escher-driver, 83 % for dioxus-native-dom or 90 % for blitz-test-harness. · guard: CoverageFloorTest
  decision/per-crate-coverage-floor · Per-crate coverage floor — CI holds a coverage floor per crate. · guard: coverage_floor.py
  decision/per-crate-coverage-floors · Per-crate line coverage floors — The coverage leg gates line coverage by per-crate floors: escher-driver 97 %, dioxus-native-dom 83 %, blitz-test-harness 90 %. · guard: coverage_floor.py
