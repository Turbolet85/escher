## design-philosophy · ## Design Philosophy
decision/headless-test-harness · Headless test harness — The engine is tested without a window, GPU or compositor, and synthesized input routes through the real event-dispatch pipeline.
decision/layout-modes-identical · Both layout modes give identical layouts — Both layout modes produce identical layouts.
decision/node-id-in-public-api · NodeId at every public API — The slotmap key is used only at the storage boundary, and every public API takes a `NodeId`.
decision/versioned-node-ids · Versioned node ids — Node ids are versioned, so a dropped node's id stops resolving instead of aliasing a reused slot; the slotmap key is used only at the storage boundary and every public API takes NodeId.
decision/headless-measurable-testable · Headless, measurable, testable engine — The engine is exercised without a window through a headless harness, a WPT runner and phase-split benchmarks.
decision/injected-embedder-services · Embedder services injected, with no-op defaults — Networking, navigation, shell and parsing reach the DOM only through provider traits the embedder supplies, and a provider not supplied falls back to a no-op default.

## stack-and-technologies · ## Stack and Technologies
decision/serde-json-driver-reader · serde_json as the driver's JSON reader — serde_json is escher-driver's reader of MCP requests, of kept checks and of the live answer line a replay compares. · why: already in the graph through dioxus-html
decision/stand-repeat-zero-failure-budget · Stand-repeat zero-failure budget — The stand-repeat leg holds the stand checks to a zero-failure budget over three rounds: the first red command ends the leg with its status, with no retry, no `--ignored` and no environment variable, and three green rounds are needed. · guard: test_stand_repeat_leg_runs_three_rounds
decision/cognitive-complexity-ceiling · Cognitive complexity ceiling — A cognitive-complexity reading on the dev host alone, never in CI, reads each function against a ceiling of 15 with rust-code-analysis-cli.
decision/keyboard-types-named-by-absolute-path · Workspace keyboard-types named by absolute path — A module that glob-imports the Dioxus prelude names the workspace's keyboard-types crate as ::keyboard_types. · why: Dioxus carries its own keyboard-types 0.7 beside the workspace's 0.8, so two versions stand in the graph.
decision/no-prng-crate · No PRNG crate for seeded randomness — Seeded randomness takes no PRNG crate: splitmix64 is written by hand and the host fallback seed comes from std RandomState. · why: no package enters the lockfile

## established-decisions · ## Established Decisions
decision/actions-answer-crossing · Actions answer crosses the carriers — The actions answer crosses the session socket's call, the command line and MCP and rests in a kept check as the actions verb's answer, holding stable ids, owner ids, the table's verb words, the closed cause words and booleans, never a value, typed text or NodeId. · why: A boundary widening, ratified; no new carrier, exit, cause, session error, span field or dependency.
decision/actions-keyed-reading · Actions answer's keyed reading — The actions answer carries the keyed reading.
decision/cross-process-session-unsupported-on-windows · Cross-process session unsupported on Windows — On Windows the cross-process lifecycle and a call sent across it return Unsupported, while a session held in process works on every target. · why: Windows has no std local socket.
decision/dioxus-memory-history · Dioxus navigation in memory — Dioxus navigation uses in-memory `MemoryHistory`.
decision/driver-library-side-effect-free · Driver library without side channels — The driver library depends on no app, emits no event, installs no subscriber and reads no env var.
decision/driver-spans-only · Driver opens spans and emits no event — The driver opens one tracing span per call it runs and one tool_call span per MCP tools/call request, and emits no event, installs no subscriber, reads no env var and has no default state location.
decision/kept-check-masking · Kept check keeps masking — A kept check records a masked or unresolved type as one fixed stand-in, and keeps each answer as a 64-bit digest and whole, masked as on every carrier, a shot's without its pixels.
decision/kept-check-never-logged · Kept check never logged — A kept check's screens, ids, names, values, snapshot text, diffs, findings, graph and actions answers rest at rest only, never logged and never named by a tool call.
decision/kept-check-replays-through-run · Kept check replays through the one run path — A kept check replays through the session's one call-running path alone, and a coverage role reading one from a named path bounds the read at the check size limit plus one byte.
decision/new-carrier-widens-boundary · New carriers widen the session boundary — A new carrier or exit for a driver session is a widening of its boundary.
decision/no-node-id-across-session · No NodeId crosses a session — Only ids, names, masked values, snapshot text, diffs, shots, lint findings, closed words, booleans and counts cross a driver session, never a `NodeId`.
decision/recorded-session-checks · Recorded sessions kept as owner-only checks — A session whose launcher names a recording directory keeps its answered calls at rest as one owner-only replayable check, never logged and never named by a tool call. · except: the repository's two committed stand checks are not owner-only
decision/recorded-session-kept-check · Recorded session kept as a replayable check — A session whose launcher names a recording directory keeps its answered calls at rest as one owner-only replayable check, std only with no dependency added, unix only like the socket. · except: The repository's own two scripted stand checks are committed in git, the one exception to owner-only.
decision/serde-json-reader-only · serde_json as a reader only — The driver takes serde_json from the workspace with no feature, as a reader of MCP requests, of kept checks and of the live answer line a replay compares, writing nothing. · why: Ratified as read only.
decision/session-library-depends-on-no-app · Session library depends on no app — The driver's session library takes the app's boot from its caller and depends on no app; no manifest under packages names an example, and the one edge runs from the app to the driver.
decision/socket-carries-driver-calls · Session socket carries driver calls — The session socket carries the session's lifecycle and a driver call and its answer: a call takes an element id and typed text in, an answer takes ids, accessible names, control values (a password's or a file input's as the fixed mask), the snapshot's text and the diff out, and no NodeId crosses. · why: A boundary widening, ratified.
contract/actions-verb/answer · the actions verb · answer — The actions verb answers the whole screen at once, unpaged.
contract/actions-verb/arguments · the actions verb · arguments — The actions verb takes no argument; a call given one is refused malformed with nothing run.
contract/document-defaults/incremental-layout · Document defaults · incremental layout — Incremental layout is on.
decision/apple-system-font-alias · Apple system font names map to system-ui — `-apple-system` maps to system-ui on Apple targets and `BlinkMacSystemFont` maps to system-ui on macOS.
decision/bridge-removal-drops-subtree · Bridge removal drops the subtree — A node the Dioxus bridge removes is dropped with its descendants and no longer resolves.
decision/click-after-scroll-advances-past-fade · Click after scroll waits out the scrollbar fade — A driver click inside a just-scrolled box advances the virtual clock past the overlay scrollbar's fade first, since a main-button pointerdown in the shown scrollbar band is taken as a thumb drag and dispatches nothing. · why: a measured hazard of the overlay scrollbar, no engine change · except: A row of an open select list is never taken as a thumb drag.
decision/click-focuses-button · A click focuses a button — A click on a button of any type or a submit, reset or button input focuses it, then submits the form owner for a submit button; a disabled form control stops the walk first, and a click on any other element still clears focus. · why: ratified · except: a select focuses through its own arm, and a multiple select's row focuses its select
decision/closed-select-options-covered · Closed select options refused as covered — An option of a closed single select, under a group too, takes no click and stays refused `covered`.
decision/coverage-reads-named-checks · Coverage role reads named check files — The command line's `coverage` role reads kept-check files its caller names on argv, bounded and read strictly. · why: a ratified boundary widening
decision/coverage-role-reads-named-checks · Coverage role reads kept checks its caller names — The command line's coverage role, coverage <app> <check>..., reads kept-check file paths its caller names, each read bounded and parsed as a check; an unreadable, over-bound, non-check or other-app file is refused malformed holding nothing of the path. · why: A boundary widening, ratified; no new socket message, MCP tool, verb, cause, span field or dependency.
decision/default-font-fallback · Default font when no listed family is available — When none of an element's listed font families is available, the default font is used, for text and for ch and ex metrics alike. · why: an upstream behaviour change taken, ratified for its take
decision/default-generic-font-size · Default generic font size — The default generic base font size is 13px for monospace and 16px otherwise.
decision/disabled-one-reading · One reading of disabled — A form control's `disabled` is read by its presence through one reading, which focusability, the pointer and click gates and the Enter and Space activation all use.
decision/disabled-read-on-form-control-only · Disabled read on a form control alone — The disabled attribute is read by its presence alone, bare, "false" or "true", and only on a form control (button, input, select, textarea); focusability, the click walk, activation and the snapshot's clickable all read it so. · why: ratified
decision/document-clock · The document's clock — Every engine time read goes through the document's configured clock, wall time when it is unset and a virtual clock headlessly, a sub-document carrying its parent's clock, with every timing constant unchanged. · why: ratified; an API addition whose default keeps every windowed and embedder-built document's behaviour
decision/driver-uses-tracing · tracing in the driver — The driver takes tracing from the workspace with no cargo feature.
decision/fixed-program-text-on-carriers · Program's fixed text rides the ratified carriers — The command line's stdout and the mcp role's stdio carry the program's own fixed text, static data of the one table (help, a session error's remedy, each tool's description and result fields); text from a page, a call or a screen, a new carrier or a new exit still widens. · why: Ratified; no dependency added.
decision/fragment-link-scrolls-in-page · Fragment-only links scroll in page — A link that changes only the fragment scrolls within the page; an empty or unmatched top fragment scrolls to the top.
decision/headless-documents-default-threading · Headless documents keep default style threading — No headless document — harness, stand or driver — sets style threading.
decision/headless-light-scheme · Headless documents use the light scheme — Headless documents and the WPT viewport use the light colour scheme.
decision/incremental-layout-default · Incremental layout on by default — Incremental layout defaults to on.
decision/mcp-stdio-crossing · Session calls over the MCP role's stdio — A session's calls also cross from an MCP client over the escher-session mcp role's stdio, a child of that client local to the invoking user, holding its session in its own process with no listener. · why: A boundary widening, ratified.
decision/media-type-screen-default · CSS media type defaults to screen — The CSS media type defaults to screen.
decision/parallel-traversals-serialised · Parallel style traversals serialised — Parallel style traversals are serialised process-wide by one static lock, its poison recovered with no panic path. · why: so two documents resolving Parallel concurrently on Stylo's global pool no longer panic (blitz issue 430)
decision/render-blocking-head-stylesheets · Render-blocking head stylesheets — `<head>` stylesheets are render-blocking critical resources, and `resolve` returns before styling while any are pending. · guard: render_blocking_stylesheet
decision/scrollbar-width-zero · Layout scrollbar width is zero — The scrollbar width handed to layout is always 0.
decision/sequential-style-default · Sequential style threading by default — Style threading defaults to Sequential, which bypasses Stylo's global thread pool.
decision/skipped-font-formats · Skipped font formats — SVG and EOT fonts are skipped, and WOFF/WOFF2 fonts too without the `woff` feature.
contract/document-defaults/color-scheme · Document defaults · ColorScheme — Headless documents and the WPT viewport use `ColorScheme::Light`.
contract/document-defaults/document-mode · Document defaults · document mode — Documents are always HTML in no-quirks mode.
contract/document-defaults/media-type · Document defaults · CSS media type — The CSS media type is `screen`.
contract/document-defaults/stylo-prefs · Document defaults · Stylo prefs — A fixed set of Stylo prefs is enabled.
contract/tool-call-span/tool · tool_call span · tool — The table's word for the tool, absent for an unknown tool; one of the two fields the tool_call span under the target escher_driver holds, beside ending and no other.

## conventions · ## Conventions
decision/both-layout-modes · Scenarios in both layout modes — Test scenarios run in both layout modes, incremental off and on. · except: upstream-taken blitz-tests targets are kept as taken even where they run one layout mode; escher's own targets run both
decision/driver-hand-built-spans · Driver spans built by hand — escher-driver builds its spans by hand, with no `#[instrument]`.
decision/mutex-poison-recovery · Mutex locks recover from poisoning — Mutex locks recover from poisoning by taking the inner value.
decision/scenarios-both-layout-modes · Scenarios in both layout modes — Scenarios run in both layout modes.
decision/shared-fixtures-stated-once · Shared blitz-tests fixtures stated once — The blitz-tests fixture module states the fixture boot and hold, the shared fixture pages and the held network stand-in once.
decision/do-not-reorder-marker · Ordering-sensitive block marker — An ordering-sensitive block is marked "WARNING: DO NOT REORDER".
decision/error-enums · Error types as enums — Error types are enums with `Display` and a `From` per wrapped error.
decision/fixtures-test-module · Shared fixtures test module — A `fixtures` test module, read by `mod fixtures;`, states once the fixture boot and hold, the fixture pages more than one check reads and the held network stand-in `HeldNet`; a page with one reader stays in its check's file.
decision/std-result-under-dioxus-prelude · std Result spelled under the Dioxus prelude glob — A file that glob-imports the dioxus_native prelude spells a two-parameter result as std::result::Result. · why: On Android the glob brings manganis's one-parameter Result alias, a failure only the CI Android job sees.
decision/test-document-setup · Test document setup — Test documents are built from HTML with a `DocumentConfig` holding a `ColorScheme::Light` viewport and the HTML provider, then resolved at time zero.

## standard-contracts · ## Standard Contracts
decision/actionable-elements-keyed · Every actionable element reads an author key — Every element an agent can act on reads an author key; unkeyed_actionable is the check that lists each actionable element whose stable id holds a /. · why: A ratified public contract addition. · guard: stand_actionable_keys
decision/answers-written-by-own-json-writer · Answers written by the driver's own JSON writer — Every answer the driver gives has one written form, a line of JSON keyed by the schema's own words and written by the driver's own output-only writer; no serialization crate writes one, and serde_json only reads MCP requests and kept checks. · why: Ratified as serde_json for reading only.
decision/cells-not-a-lean-task · Cells is not a lean task — The Cells task boots through its own stand entry and is kept out of the lean task set. · why: Its screen passes the snapshot text's budget and reads in parts.
decision/diff-content-never-logged · Diff content never logged — A diff's content never reaches a log or event; only its three counts of added, removed and changed may be recorded on the driver's command span. · why: Ratified.
decision/driver-logs-no-content · Driver logs no content — Nothing in escher-driver logs an id, a name or a value.
decision/hand-written-answers · Driver answers written by hand — Every driver answer is written by hand in a crate-private module; no serialization crate writes one, serde_json only reading MCP requests and kept checks.
decision/harness-counts-loads-at-net-provider · Harness counts loads at the net provider — A supplied non-noop net provider is wrapped in a counting provider that counts a request in flight until its handler is consumed or dropped and forwards errors; an offline harness or a wrapped document is read through its pending critical resources alone. · why: Loads are counted where every request crosses.
decision/input-helpers-do-not-settle · Input helpers do not settle — Pump, tick, advance-time, dispatch and every input helper settle nothing; settling is asked for separately.
decision/keyed-wire-form · keyed as the actionable-key wire form — ActionableNode's keyed reading, true where the id holds no /, is the actionable-key check's first wire form, carried by the actions verb on every carrier.
decision/load-page-message-hidden-until-sheet · Load button links one sheet that reveals Loaded — The load page's Load button links one stylesheet, and the Loaded paragraph stays hidden until that sheet lands. · why: Pinned by the_load_page_click_waits_out_its_load_and_shows_the_message and the_load_page_enter_waits_out_its_load_and_shows_the_message
decision/masked-input-values · Password and file input values masked — A password or file input's value reads MASKED_VALUE when non-empty and empty when empty, never the text, its length or a file's host path.
decision/no-echo-of-typed-input · No echo of typed input — No driver command's ending writes back anything the caller typed.
decision/no-seed-on-carriers · No seed crosses the driver's carriers — No run seed crosses the driver's carriers: no verb, argument, command-line flag, MCP tool field, kept-check key or span field carries one, so every driver session and every kept check's replay reads the default seed; a seed reaches a run only from in-process code that builds its VirtualDom. · why: A seed on a carrier would widen the session boundary; the absence is the operator's answer A to the founder's fork, standing PROVISIONAL until the founder confirms or replaces it. · provisional
decision/no-snapshot-in-logs · No snapshot content in logs — No log or event carries the snapshot, its text or a diff. · except: a diff's three counts, added, removed and changed, on escher-driver's command span.
decision/refusal-causes-closed-at-eight · Refusal causes closed at eight — The set of refusal causes is closed at eight, each with a fixed name, meaning and remedy, and a refusal holds nothing a call supplied. · why: Ratified.
decision/refused-call-records-no-ids · A call validation refuses records no ids — A call the schema's validation refuses records nothing in the session's record of seen ids; every snapshot a validated call takes is recorded, on a refusal too. · why: Ratified.
decision/seen-ids-record-bounded · Session's record of seen ids bounded — Between calls a session keeps of its screens only id text, at most 4096 ids, never an id longer than a call can name, forgetting the one read longest ago past the bound; the record has no public reader and is never printed or logged. · why: Ratified for ids longer than a call can name. · guard: the_record_holds_no_id_longer_than_a_call_can_name
decision/snapshot-text-never-logged · Snapshot text never logged — The snapshot text leaves the process only as a returned value or a hosted call's answer; no log or event carries it, and a kept check holds it only in an owner-only file never logged. · why: Ratified. · except: The two committed checks are the one exception to owner-only.
decision/stand-offline · Stand boots offline — Every stand boot is offline, with no net provider and no base URL. · guard: the_stand_options_stay_offline · except: The load page boot replaces the net provider with its own network stand-in.
decision/stand-pinned-environment · Stand pins its environment — Every headless stand boot uses a pinned 800 by 600 viewport at scale 1.0 in the light colour scheme, installs no telemetry and reads no environment variable.
decision/stand-readings-same-on-every-ci-os · Stand readings identical on every CI OS — The six served stand tasks read the same driver answer digests of snapshot, lint and actions on linux x86_64, windows x86_64 and macOS aarch64, in both layout modes, at boot and after one step, compared with no screenshot. · guard: stand_cross_os_readings
decision/stand-typography-dejavu-sans · Stand typography is DejaVu Sans — Every stand boot loads one font, the bundled DejaVu Sans, with system fonts off, so every generic family and any unavailable named family lays out in DejaVu Sans by fallback; the typography is stated in the stand contract, not on the design-system product surface. · guard: stand_bundled_font_families
decision/validated-commands-only · Driver commands run only after validation — Every driver call runs through the session's one run entry, which validates first; nothing public runs a command that did not come from validation.
decision/validated-verb-set-widened-by-ratification · Validated verb set widened only by ratification — The driver's validated verb set is closed; a verb joins it only as a ratified widening of that set, at the instance, session or tool level. · why: Each verb beyond the first acting verbs joined as a ratified widening of the validated verb set.
contract/acting-verb-results/settled · acting verb results · settled — A flag; a step that did not go quiet is a result with settled false and its busy class, never a refusal or a session error, and is not rolled back.
contract/actionable-nodes/actionable-nodes · Actionable nodes · actionable_nodes — Read-only under accessibility, returns id, owner and keyed for each UI graph node the actionable rule holds for or whose owner is set, in snapshot pre-order; keyed is true where the id holds no /.
contract/actionable-readers/actionable-nodes · Dioxus actionable readers · DioxusDocument::actionable_nodes — actionable_nodes lists, read-only and in snapshot pre-order, every UI graph node the actionable rule holds for or the graph gives an owner, as an ActionableNode (id, owner, keyed where the id holds no /).
contract/actions-verb/acceptance · The actions verb · acceptance — Each verb's call is built with fixed in-bound values for other required arguments and run through the same validation and per-verb target check a real call meets.
contract/actions-verb/changes-nothing · The actions verb · side effects — The actions read changes nothing: no changes are pending after it, the snapshot, both focus readings and the diff are unchanged, and an open select list stays open.
contract/actions-verb/meaning · The actions verb · accepted — `actions` answers whether a call would be accepted, not what it would do.
contract/actions-verb/stale · The actions verb · stale — A node that resolves to no element reads `stale`.
contract/actions-verb/target-verbs · The actions verb · target verbs — For each node listed, the read covers each instance verb that takes an id argument, in table order, today `click` · `type` · `scroll` · `screenshot`.
contract/actions-verb/unpaged · The actions verb · paging — `actions` takes no argument and answers the whole screen at once, unpaged, within the 1,048,576-byte answer bound.
contract/answer-json/actions · answer JSON · actions — {"nodes":[{"id","owner","keyed","verbs":[{"verb","cause"}]}]}, owner and cause left out when absent; never a value, typed text or NodeId.
contract/check-replay/first-difference · Check replay · first difference — Each step's call runs through the session, validated again, and the replay stops at the first step whose acceptance differs or whose live answer is not equal to the kept answer.
contract/ci-leg-legs/stand-repeat · ci-leg.sh legs · stand-repeat — The `stand-repeat` leg runs three rounds of every `stand_*` blitz-tests target plus named targets, then the seven_guis CLI, host, MCP and recording tests, ending `stand-repeat: 3 of 3 rounds green`.
contract/command-span/never-fielded · command span · never fielded — No screen text, image, findings, graph, actions answer, label, id record, argument, call, outcome or refusal value is ever a field.
contract/dioxus-bridge/stable-id · Dioxus DOM bridge · element_id and element_ids — element_id and element_ids compute a stable id on demand in four tiers (author key, anchored path, component path, document path), written to neither DOM nor vdom.
contract/dioxus-native-dom-api/is-masked-input · dioxus-native-dom public API · is_masked_input — Public and re-exported beside MASKED_VALUE: true for an input whose type reads password or file, ASCII case-insensitive; the test the snapshot's value reader and the driver's recorder read.
contract/dioxus-native-dom-api/use-seeded-random · dioxus-native-dom public API · use_seeded_random and DEFAULT_SEED — Public and re-exported: use_seeded_random returns the root's SeededRandom from a root context, else a generator seeded from the host's per-process random keys, the windowed shell's case outside any run; DEFAULT_SEED is the u64 seed 0.
contract/driver-forms/is-masked-input · driver form-control readers · is_masked_input — is_masked_input is the one masked-control test: a password or file input.
contract/driver-public-api/no-serde-json-types · Driver public API · serde_json types — No public accessor of a check, a step, a replay or a change returns or holds a `serde_json` type.
contract/driver-recording/kept-check · escher-driver recording · kept check — The recording keeps a session's answered calls as a kept check, a masked type as its stand-in and a shot without its pixels; a session started in a fixture state keeps the reach's steps as ordinary calls, so its check replays from boot in the unchanged form.
contract/driver-recording/replay · escher-driver recording · Check::replay — Check::replay runs a kept check's calls again through Session::run.
contract/driver-session/command-schema · escher-driver session · command and refusal schema — The command and refusal schema is stated once as 'static data: fourteen verbs, eight closed causes.
contract/driver-session/no-nodeid · escher-driver session · NodeId — No NodeId crosses the driver session boundary.
contract/driver-session/reach · escher-driver session · Session::reach — Session::reach runs each acting step (click, type, press, advance) of a named fixture state as a validated call through the one run path, in process, and stops at the first refused or unsettled step with the earlier steps standing, not rolled back.
contract/driver-session/refusal-content · escher-driver session · refusal — No refusal holds what a call supplied.
contract/driver-verbs/actions · driver verbs · actions — No argument; result nodes, what each actionable node can take now; dispatches nothing, runs no step.
contract/driver-verbs/screenshot · driver verbs · screenshot — One optional id; result width, height and png (base64), always present; an element shot is cropped to its visible bounds; no step, nothing changes.
contract/escher-session/invocation · escher-session command line · invocation — escher-session <verb> [arguments] --session <dir> drives the stand's six served tasks: counter, flight-booker, timer, crud, cells, load.
contract/headless-stand/boot · seven_guis headless stand · seven_guis::stand — seven_guis::stand, native only, boots the four lean tasks, Cells and a load page in a pinned 800x600 Light viewport with one bundled font.
contract/headless-stand/no-telemetry · seven_guis headless stand · telemetry and environment — The stand installs no telemetry, reads no env var and names no blitz_net.
contract/headless-stand/offline-boots · seven_guis headless stand · network — Every stand boot is offline but the load page's, whose one stylesheet fetch the in-process stand-in LoadNet answers after LOAD_ANSWER_DELAY (200 ms).
contract/kept-check-reader/refusal · Kept check reader · malformed refusal — Anything else is refused `Cause::Malformed` with no fault, nothing of the file held and no panic path.
contract/kept-check-reader/strict-read · Kept check reader · strict read — A kept check is read strictly: at most 1,048,576 bytes, a JSON array of at most 400 records, closed keys, the ten instance verbs, schema argument names, `masked` on `type` alone, `digest` 16 lowercase hex, `answer` a required JSON object; key order is not enforced.
contract/kept-check/accepted · Kept check file · accepted — Each record states whether the call was accepted.
contract/kept-check/answer · Kept check file · answer — `answer` is the answer's line as the driver wrote it, inlined as its own JSON object, masked as on every carrier, kept whole except a shot's pixels: a shot keeps `{"width":…,"height":…}` with no `png`.
contract/kept-check/arguments · Kept check file · arguments — A record's `arguments` are written in the verb's schema order; a call naming an argument its schema does not name, or naming one twice, is not kept.
contract/kept-check/bounds · Kept check file · size bounds — A kept check holds at most 400 records and 1,048,576 bytes.
contract/kept-check/digest · Kept check file · digest — `digest` is a hand-written FNV-1a 64 (offset basis 0xcbf29ce484222325, prime 0x100000001b3) over the answer's JSON line, written as 16 lowercase hex digits.
contract/kept-check/kept-verbs · Kept check file · kept verbs — Only calls of the ten instance verbs are kept, `lint`, `graph` and `actions` among them with their answers whole; any other call is not kept.
contract/kept-check/masked · Kept check file · masked — `masked` is written `true` on a `type` record alone; a `type` whose element resolves to a masked control or to none keeps the text `"masked"` and `masked:true`, every other `type` keeps its text as it crossed.
contract/kept-check/opening-record · Kept check file · opening record — A kept check opens with the record `{"tool":"start","arguments":{"app":<label>}}`.
contract/kept-check/tool · Kept check file · tool — Each answered call kept appends one record whose `tool` is the verb called.
contract/node-keys/clickable · node keys · clickable — True where the element's current listeners hold click and it is no disabled form control; a boolean on every node.
contract/node-keys/enabled · node keys · enabled — Follows the disabled attribute's presence whatever its value; left out when absent.
contract/node-keys/id · node keys · id — The element's stable id, always written.
contract/node-keys/role · node keys · role — The role as the accessibility tree reads it, always written.
contract/node-keys/value · node keys · value — The control's value, a fixed mask for a password or file input; left out when absent.
contract/recording/directory · Session recording · record directory — A recording makes its directory owner-only or refuses it with `RecordDirNotPrivate`.
contract/recording/failure · Session recording · recording failure — Past the bounds or on a failed write the recording ends: its check is removed, nothing further is kept, the call is not rolled back, and the session reports the failure once.
contract/refusal-causes/covered · refusal causes · covered — Another element is hit at the point the action would land; its meaning states the closed-select option, one-axis clip and zero-size box readings.
contract/refusal-causes/disabled · refusal causes · disabled — A click or type target reads enabled false; checked first of the three screen-level causes.
contract/refusal-causes/fonts-unavailable · refusal causes · fonts-unavailable — The app has no font it can paint text with; screenshot and lint refuse with nothing painted or read; remedy: boot the app with a font it can decode.
contract/refusal-causes/malformed · refusal causes · malformed — An argument is unnamed, repeated, missing, of another kind or out of bound, carried with its fault; returned by validation.
contract/refusal-causes/not-found · refusal causes · not-found — The id names no element on the screen as it reads now and the session's record does not hold it; nothing runs.
contract/refusal-causes/off-screen · refusal causes · off-screen — The element lies outside the viewport or a scrolling box's visible part, or a screenshot crop holds no pixel; remedy: bring it into view with scroll, then act again.
contract/refusal-causes/stale · refusal causes · stale — The id names no element on the screen now but the session's record of read ids holds it; nothing runs.
contract/refusal-causes/unknown-verb · refusal causes · unknown-verb — The verb is not in the table by exact name, or a session- or tool-level verb is handed where an instance verb is run; returned by validation.
contract/refusal-faults/missing · refusal faults · Missing — A required argument is absent; beside malformed only.
contract/refusal-faults/out-of-bound · refusal faults · OutOfBound — An argument's value is outside its bound, or a text is no key name; beside malformed only.
contract/refusal-faults/repeated · refusal faults · Repeated — An argument name was passed before in the same call; beside malformed only.
contract/refusal-faults/unnamed · refusal faults · Unnamed — An argument names nothing the verb takes; beside malformed only.
contract/refusal-faults/wrong-kind · refusal faults · WrongKind — An argument's value is of another kind than the schema's; beside malformed only.
contract/session-errors/not-settled · session errors · not-settled — An in-process act whose instance did not go quiet, the message appending the busy class; the step is not rolled back.
contract/session-errors/record-dir-not-private · session errors · record-dir-not-private — One of the fifteen fixed session error kinds, with a fixed message and remedy; a start or mcp given --record checks the recording directory first.
contract/session-errors/unsupported · session errors · unsupported — On a non-unix target serve, start, attach, stop, call of an admitted call and recording into a directory return it; a session held in process without a recording works everywhere.
contract/snapshot-diff/values · Snapshot diff · values — Values come from the two snapshots only, so a password or file input reads MASKED_VALUE, and no field holds a process-local id or pointer.
contract/snapshot-node-keys/expanded · Snapshot node keys · expanded — The snapshot carries no expanded key and NodeState no field for a list; NODE_FIELDS keeps fourteen keys.
contract/snapshot/no-process-local-values · Snapshot · process-local values — No snapshot field holds a NodeId, an AccessKit tree id, an ElementId, a ScopeId or a pointer.
contract/snapshot/node-state · Snapshot · NodeState — NodeState carries eight fields in the order enabled, checked, value, selected, pressed, invalid, focused, clickable.
contract/snapshot/snapshot-node · Snapshot · SnapshotNode — A SnapshotNode carries id, role, name, state, bounds and children; a Snapshot offers nodes in pre-order and get by stable element id.
contract/stable-element-id/no-process-local-values · Stable element ids · process-local values — No NodeId, ElementId, ScopeId or pointer enters an id.
contract/stable-element-id/persistence · Stable element ids · persistence — Every element present before and after a re-render reads the same id; a remount reads the same id list in order, and a second process reads the same id lists.
contract/target-check/click-type · Per-verb target check · click and type — `click` and `type` are refused `disabled`, then `off-screen`, then `covered`.
contract/test-harness/run-seed · blitz-test-harness · harness run seed — Harness::from_vdom provides SeededRandom::from_seed(DEFAULT_SEED) as a root context where the vdom's root holds none, before the document is built; a SeededRandom the builder gave as a root context stands; Harness::wrap provides none.
contract/validation-order/first-failure · call validation · first failure — One answer a call, the first failure in order: the verb by exact name, then the call's arguments as passed, then the verb's arguments in the schema's order; a refused call changes nothing.
decision/a11y-leg-widens-without-new-job · Accessibility leg widens in place — The a11y leg gains tests with no new job, no required status check and no workflow change. · guard: LegScriptTest.test_gate_legs_dispatch_to_cargo_and_write_their_log
decision/accessibility-feature-gate · Snapshot readers behind the accessibility feature — A crate taking a Dioxus crate with default features off gets the snapshot, its text, its diff and the actionable-key check only by naming the accessibility feature or depending on a crate that names it.
decision/capability-statement-matches-schema · Capability statement held to the driver schema — The capability statement and README name every verb and refusal cause and state in words the counts of verbs, refusal causes, session errors, node keys and exit statuses that the driver schema holds. · guard: CapabilityStatementTest
decision/cells-grid-single-tab-stop · Cells grid is one Tab stop with arrow and Enter editing — The cells-grid is one Tab stop whose arrows move the current cell and whose Enter opens the editor, an editor Enter committing and returning focus to the grid. · why: Pinned by the stand_keyboard Cells walk and stand_cells_served, which read focus back on cells-grid after an editor Enter
decision/double-click-window · Two clicks without an advance read as a double click — Two clicks on one point with no advance of at least 500 ms between them read as a double click, as the click verb's help says. · why: Ratified.
decision/listeners-read-from-vdom · Listeners read from the vdom walk — Every reader of an element's listeners reads the vdom walk's current listeners, never the bridge's listener mark. · why: The listener mark over-reports: a listener a re-render removes leaves its attribute and mark standing, and a mounted listener writes none.
decision/no-node-id-crosses-the-socket · Calls and outcomes cross as lines, no NodeId — Across the socket a call travels as a request line and its outcome or refusal comes back as one line of JSON, and no engine NodeId is in either. · why: Ratified.
decision/one-actionable-rule · One actionable rule — Both actionable readers read one actionable rule: focusable, an interactive role, or current listeners holding an event other than mounted.
contract/actionable-element/definition · Actionable element · definition — An element is actionable when it is focusable, its role is one of the closed interactive roles, or its current listeners hold an event other than mounted; unkeyed_actionable and actionable_nodes read this one rule.
contract/answer-json/outcome · answer JSON · outcome — An object keyed by its verb's result fields in the table's order, busy present only when not settled.
contract/answer-json/string-escaping · answer JSON · string escaping — A string escapes ", \ and U+0000 to U+001F.
contract/argument-kinds/id · argument kinds · id — 1 to 1024 bytes of text.
contract/argument-kinds/key · argument kinds · key — One of the twelve key names, else out of bound.
contract/argument-kinds/text · argument kinds · text — 0 to 4096 bytes of text.
contract/check-replay/another-app · Check replay · another app — A replay runs nothing on a session whose label is not the check's app.
contract/cli-coverage-role/1 · Command line coverage role · 1 — A file that cannot be read, one past the bound, one that is no check, or a check whose app is not `<app>` is refused `malformed`, holding nothing of the path or the file.
contract/cli-exit-statuses/2 · CLI exit statuses · 2 — usage: one fixed line on stderr built from the verbs and the app names, stdout empty; includes a --session absent where needed or given twice.
contract/cli-usage-line/role-clauses · Command line usage line · role clauses — The usage line reads `; mcp role: mcp [--record <dir>]`, then `; coverage role: coverage <app> <check>...;` before `; apps:`.
contract/dioxus-bridge/clickable · Dioxus DOM bridge · clickable — The snapshot's clickable reads an element's own current click listener, on no disabled form control.
contract/dioxus-native-dom-api/seeded-random · dioxus-native-dom public API · SeededRandom — Public and re-exported: a splitmix64 generator whose clones share one state, so every component of one document draws from one stream in draw order; from_seed(u64), next_u64 and below(bound), the high bits of the 128-bit product, 0 for a bound of 0, no panic path; Debug writes the type name alone.
contract/document-event/navigate-iframe · DocumentEvent messages · NavigateIframe — Carries the node id and URL of an iframe to navigate.
contract/driver-session/schema-carriers · escher-driver session · schema carriers — The v3 wire, the command line, the MCP server and the command and tool_call spans carry the one command and refusal schema.
contract/driver-verbs/click · driver verbs · click — Takes id; clicks the centre of the element's bounds after the disabled, off-screen and covered checks; a click on a select opens its list.
contract/driver-verbs/scroll · driver verbs · scroll — Takes id; accepted on a disabled or covered element, scrolls it into view as one settled step and adds in_view, always present, false when no scroll could bring it in view or it was removed.
contract/driver-verbs/type · driver verbs · type — Takes id and text; on a select chooses the first option whose label starts with the text, on a multiple select its match alone, a text opening on a space typing nothing.
contract/escher-session-cli/usage · escher-session command line · usage — escher-session <verb> [arguments] --session <dir> drives six served stand tasks: the four lean ones, Cells and the load page.
contract/escher-session/actions · escher-session command line · actions — The verb actions takes no argument beside --session.
contract/escher-session/click · escher-session command line · click --id — The verb click takes --id.
contract/escher-session/press · escher-session command line · press --key [--shift] — The verb press takes --key and an optional --shift.
contract/escher-session/screenshot · escher-session command line · screenshot [--id <id>] — The verb screenshot takes an optional --id.
contract/escher-session/scroll · escher-session command line · scroll --id — The verb scroll takes --id.
contract/escher-session/type · escher-session command line · type --id --text — The verb type takes --id and --text.
contract/form-controls/is-disabled · blitz-dom form control readers · ElementData::is_disabled — ElementData::is_disabled is the one disabled reading of a form control: a disabled attribute present.
contract/handler-coverage/per-check-boot · Handler coverage reader · per-check boot — A fresh session is booted for each check; a check whose app is not the label runs nothing and contributes nothing.
contract/headless-stand/timer-step · seven_guis headless stand · timer_step — timer_step hands the Timer its ticks for a driver session.
contract/key-names/delete · key names · delete — A key name press accepts.
contract/key-names/end · key names · end — A key name press accepts.
contract/key-names/enter · key names · enter — A key name press accepts.
contract/key-names/escape · key names · escape — A key name press accepts.
contract/key-names/home · key names · home — A key name press accepts.
contract/key-names/space · key names · space — A key name press accepts.
contract/key-names/tab · key names · tab — A key name press accepts.
contract/load-wait/verbs · Driver acting step · waiting verbs — The five acting verbs (`click` · `type` · `press` · `advance` · `scroll`) wait on every carrier; `snapshot`, `screenshot`, `lint`, `graph` and `actions` wait on nothing.
contract/node-keys/bounds · node keys · bounds — An array of four numbers, where the element stands, the same however far a box's content is scrolled; a non-finite number is null.
contract/node-keys/checked · node keys · checked — A native checkbox's or radio's own state, else the aria-checked toggle of the five checkable roles, a mixed one reading false; left out when absent.
contract/node-keys/focused · node keys · focused — Whether the element holds focus, always written.
contract/node-keys/name · node keys · name — The accessible name as the accessibility tree reads it, always written.
contract/node-keys/pressed · node keys · pressed — Read from aria-pressed, left out for the five checkable roles and where unstated; a mixed toggle reads false.
contract/node-keys/selected · node keys · selected — Read from aria-selected, written only where the element states it.
contract/refusal-json/shape · refusal JSON · shape — A refusal is written {"refused":{"cause","meaning","remedy"[,"fault"]}} from the cause's fixed strings, holding nothing the call supplied.
contract/scroll-hit/stale-id-indexing · BaseDocument scroll and hit testing · NodeTree indexing — Indexing the NodeTree with a stale id panics.
contract/scroll-hit/visible-region · BaseDocument scroll and hit testing · visible_region — visible_region is the read-only reader of what can be seen; seeing is never read from a hit.
contract/session-errors/io · session errors · io — An I/O failure, its fixed message appending the I/O error kind's name.
contract/snapshot/clickable · Snapshot · clickable — True where the element's current listeners hold click and the element is no disabled form control.
contract/snapshot/enabled · Snapshot · enabled — Reads the presence of the disabled attribute on an element that can be disabled, so disabled="false" and a bare disabled both read Some(false); aria-disabled moves no reading.
contract/snapshot/membership · Snapshot · node membership — A node is an accessibility tree node with an author_id whose element resolves; the Window, the document root and text runs are not nodes, their kept descendants attaching to the nearest kept ancestor.
contract/snapshot/value · Snapshot · value — A select's chosen option value, unmasked (a multiple select's first chosen), else the editor text, else a range input's current value, else the value attribute of a textarea or text-entry input.
contract/stable-element-id/element-id · Stable element ids · element_id — Returns an element's stable id, None for a non-element, stale or detached node, and never panics; the id is computed on demand and written to neither the DOM nor the vdom.
contract/stable-element-id/element-ids · Stable element ids · element_ids — Returns every element reachable from the document root, in document pre-order, with ids pairwise distinct.
contract/stable-element-id/removed-node · Stable element ids · removed node — A node a re-render removes is dropped with its descendants and no longer resolves: element_id reads None and element_ids holds no pair for it.
contract/target-check/screenshot · Per-verb target check · screenshot with an id — A `screenshot` given an `id` meets in-view, then an empty crop, then `fonts-unavailable`, before anything is painted.
contract/telemetry-panic/panic-event · Telemetry panic event · panic event — A panic emits an ERROR at target escher_telemetry::panic with panic.file, panic.line, panic.column and a redacted panic.payload, then runs the previous hook.
contract/telemetry-scrub/content-span-fields · Telemetry scrub · content span fields — A span field named in the content fields is never stored; other span fields are held in memory until close and written only as the rule prints them.
contract/telemetry-scrub/escher-targets · Telemetry scrub · escher targets — An event under the escher_ prefix prints every field except content fields, which are redacted.
contract/test-harness/screenshot · blitz-test-harness · screenshot and screenshot_rect — `screenshot` and `screenshot_rect` resolve at the harness's own time without tick or pump, paint a raster of the viewport through blitz-paint, composite it over opaque white, and print, panic and log nothing.
contract/test-harness/text-contrast · blitz-test-harness · text_contrast — `text_contrast` reads a WCAG contrast of an element's text over its composited background and changes nothing; it reads None when there is no such text or the background cannot be composited.
contract/verb-table/order · Driver verb table · VERBS — The verb table holds fourteen verbs, `graph` listed after `lint` and `actions` after `graph`.
contract/viewport/scale · Viewport · scale — The scale is the hidpi scale multiplied by the zoom.

## occupied-resources · ## Occupied Resources
decision/committed-stand-checks · Committed stand-Counter checks — Two kept checks of the repository's own scripted stand-Counter sessions, one through the command line and one through the mcp role, are committed publicly, holding no typed text, host path, name or secret and no screenshot step. · why: A shot's PNG bytes differ by OS, so no screenshot step is kept. · guard: seven_guis recording, comparing a fresh recording byte for byte with the committed copies · except: The one exception to a kept check's owner-only medium.
decision/kept-checks-owner-only · Kept checks on an owner-only medium — A kept check lives on an owner-only medium. · except: the two committed checks under the blitz-tests checks directory.
decision/raw-run-output-never-printed · Raw run output never printed — Raw run output kept in the state areas (merged logs, the session transcript, the server log, the parsed check and the recorded kept checks) stays unscrubbed and is never printed or copied.
decision/record-dir-launcher-named-private · Recording directory launcher-named and owner-only — The recording directory is named only by the launcher's --record option, never an env read, a default or a tool call, verb, argument or result field; created 0700 when absent and refused RecordDirNotPrivate when open to its group or others.
decision/recording-directory · Recording directory — The recording directory is a path the launcher names by --record, never an env read or a default and named by no tool call, created 0700 and refused when open to its group or others.
decision/recording-removes-only-own-checks · Recording removes only its own checks — Escher removes a check only when its recording ends on a failed write or a passed bound, never a file it did not create and never the recording directory.
decision/recording-removes-own-checks-only · Recording removes only its own checks — escher removes a check only when its recording ends on a failed write or a passed bound, never a file it did not create and never the directory.
decision/stand-load-net-answers-after-delay · Load stand-in answers from its own thread after 200 ms — The stand's LoadNet answers each fetch from a thread of its own with the fixed CSS after 200 ms, with no socket or listener. · why: the_load_page_click_leaves_a_load_in_flight and the stand_load_page checks need a load in flight that the settle waits out
decision/stand-load-page-in-process-url · Load page stylesheet URL under .test answered in process — The stand's load page names one URL under the .test TLD and is answered in process, never reaching the network. · why: The stand_load_page driver checks and the session host's load app rely on the boot answering offline with no resolver reached
contract/actions-answer/argument · The actions verb's answer · argument — The actions verb takes no argument; a call that gives one is refused malformed.
contract/actions-answer/node-fields · The actions verb's answer · node fields — Each actionable node gives its stable id, owner id and keyed boolean, the table's verb words and the closed cause words; never a value, typed text or NodeId.
contract/actions-answer/paging · The actions verb's answer · paging — The whole screen is answered unpaged, within the 1,048,576-byte answer bound; the wire adds no listener or port.
contract/recording-directory/check-file · The recording directory · check-{n}.json — One check-{n}.json per recorded session, mode 0600, created new with n the smallest from 1 naming no file, so no file is replaced; rewritten whole after every call through a temporary file and a rename.
contract/recording-directory/platform · The recording directory · platform — Recording is unix only; elsewhere it is refused Unsupported.
decision/coverage-role-in-process · Coverage role runs in process — The coverage role runs in one process with no listener, socket or port, boots one fresh session per named check through the same boot closure as the host, and opens no span of its own.
decision/headless-documents-sequential-style · Headless documents style sequentially — Sequential style threading stays the default: headless documents of the harness, the stand and the driver never set Parallel; the windowed launch, the browser and the multi-document bench example do.

## infrastructure-patterns · ## Infrastructure Patterns
decision/capabilities-doc-beside-upstream · Capability statement beside upstream docs — escher's capability statement sits in a file of its own under docs, beside upstream's three files. · why: an upstream change under docs never conflicts with it
decision/linux-tested-by-fast-leg · Linux tested by the fast leg — Linux is tested by the fast test leg, not the matrix; the matrix tests windows and macos and only builds ios and android.
decision/stand-uses-bundled-font · Stand shares the bundled font — seven_guis' bundled DejaVuSans bytes compile on native too, where the headless stand registers the same font.

## cross-cutting-patterns · ## Cross-cutting Patterns
decision/accessibility-feature-gating · Accessibility feature gating in dioxus-native-dom — The `accessibility` feature enables dioxus-native-dom's `accesskit` and gates its accessibility-tree override and its `snapshot`, `snapshot_diff`, `snapshot_text`, `actionable` and `graph` modules; its `signal_registry`, `reached` and `seed` modules stay ungated. · why: An app registers state whatever its features, and the reached record compiles on the wasm build that leaves `accessibility` off.
decision/escher-driver-spans-ungated · escher-driver spans ungated, no subscriber — escher-driver takes `tracing` with no feature, builds its `command` span and its `tool_call` span (the parent of `command` on an MCP tool call) by hand with no instrument attribute and no feature gate, and installs no subscriber.
decision/one-run-seed · One seed for a run's randomness — A run's randomness comes from one seed held as a Dioxus root context, ungated by the accessibility feature, so two runs of one seed read the same state at every step, in both layout modes and across processes. · guard: stand_seeded_randomness
decision/shell-and-navigation-providers · Shell and navigation providers — A shell provider carries redraw, clipboard and file dialogs, and a navigation provider receives link-click navigations.
decision/typed-results · Typed results for fallible APIs — Fallible APIs return typed results.
decision/platform-gating · Platform behaviour gating — Platform behaviour is gated with `cfg(target_os = ...)` and an `IS_MOBILE` const.
decision/runtime-inputs · Runtime inputs — Runtime inputs are CLI arguments and environment variables.
decision/telemetry-scrubbing · Telemetry scrubs what prints — The telemetry sink scrubs every record that prints, judging a closed span's fields by the rule that judges an event's.

## inherited-defaults · ## Inherited Defaults
decision/driver-session-unix-socket · One local Unix-domain socket — The one local listener is a Unix-domain socket, the driver session's, carrying its lifecycle and its calls.
decision/engine-tracing-gated-per-call-site · Engine tracing gated per call site — Optional capabilities are Cargo features, and in the engine and upstream crates tracing is gated per call site with `cfg(feature = "tracing")`, with a `let _ = …;` fallback when the feature is off. · except: escher-telemetry and escher-driver, its `command` and `tool_call` spans included, take `tracing` ungated; escher-telemetry has no features.

## existing-scopes · ## Existing Scopes
decision/no-screenshot-in-cross-os-byte-check · No screenshot step in cross-OS byte checks — A check compared byte for byte across OSes holds no `screenshot` step. · why: A shot's PNG bytes differ between linux x86_64 and macOS aarch64.

## project-intent · ## Project Intent
overview/project-intent — escher is a fork of Blitz, a Rust library workspace for an HTML/CSS engine (high-level APIs for rendering HTML, a core DOM abstraction whose primary entry point is BaseDocument, a Document trait so wrappers around BaseDocument can all be driven by blitz-shell), being turned into an agent-first UI framework: a headless driver (CLI and MCP), stable ids for every element, a compact semantic snapshot of the screen, proven on an internal 7GUIs stand. Development is agent-driven: the framework's own driver is meant to become the harness.
