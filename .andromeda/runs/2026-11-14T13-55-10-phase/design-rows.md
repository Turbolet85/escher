# design-system · the rows that bind 2026-11-14-auto-exploration — picked 36 of 136 (29 by every draw) · rule any · pin 922

## depth-strategy · ## Depth Strategy
decision/open-select-list-hit-first · Open select list answers hits first — hit, set_hover_to, handle_pointerdown and the driver's covered all read the open select list first, so a button under the list is refused covered. · why: the driver's covered check reads it; pinned by a_button_under_the_list_is_refused_covered and the covered fixture in stand_actions

## motion-calibrated-to-expression-level-unrecorded · ## Motion (calibrated to expression level `unrecorded`) · twin motion
decision/animation-driven-by-virtual-clock · Animation driven by the virtual clock — The test harness drives animation from the VirtualClock its documents read, and settle reads animation time only through that clock, never advancing it.
decision/load-wait-moves-no-clock · Load wait moves no clock — While an acting driver step waits on a load in flight, for at most LOAD_WAIT, the harness's VirtualClock stands still, so no timer or animation runs during the wait.
contract/driver-verbs-and-virtual-clock/click · driver verbs and the virtual clock · click — The driver's click leaves the VirtualClock where it was.
contract/driver-verbs-and-virtual-clock/press · driver verbs and the virtual clock · press — The driver's press leaves the VirtualClock where it was.
contract/driver-verbs-and-virtual-clock/type · driver verbs and the virtual clock · type — The driver's type leaves the VirtualClock where it was.
decision/settle-does-not-wait-on-animation · Settle does not wait on animation — A harness settle answers every member of the document's animating set the same way: none holds it open, none is waited on or advanced; settle returns Settled with animating reading the document's animating flag.

## motion · ## Motion (calibrated to expression level `unrecorded`) · twin motion-calibrated-to-expression-level-unrecorded
decision/driver-advance-moves-one-clock · Driver advance moves the one virtual clock — The driver's advance moves the harness virtual clock by exactly its ms and the app's own time together, while click, type and press leave the clock where it was. · why: Ratified.
decision/select-list-opens-without-motion · Select list opens and closes with no motion — The select list has no motion, so a screen read after a step reads the new state without an advance. · why: pinned by a_screen_read_after_a_step_reads_the_new_state_with_no_advance in the stand_act_popup driver tests
decision/shown-scrollbar-takes-thumb-drag · Shown overlay scrollbar takes a pointerdown as drag — Right after a scroll the shown overlay scrollbar takes a main-button pointerdown in its band as a thumb drag, so a driver click there needs an advance past the fade first. · why: pinned by dragging_the_thumb_scrolls_the_container and faded_out_thumb_does_not_capture_drags; driver clicks after a scroll advance past the fade

## surface · ## Surface: desktop-native · twin surface-desktop-native
decision/actions-share-the-verbs-checks · actions decided by the verbs' own checks — The actions answer reports whether each call would be accepted, not what it would do, deciding a node's verbs by the same validation and per-verb target check every id-taking verb meets before it acts. · why: so a listed cause is the cause the call returns
decision/exit-statuses-from-schema-table · Exit statuses read from the schema's table — The exit statuses are read from the driver schema's EXIT_STATUSES table, whose meanings help serves.
contract/actions-line/content · The actions line · content — The line carries ids, owner ids, the verb table's words, closed cause words and booleans only, never a value, typed text or NodeId.
contract/actions-line/nodes · The actions line · nodes — Every actionable node is listed in snapshot pre-order: focusable, of an interactive role, holding a current listener for an event other than mounted, or owned by another node, each with the id-taking instance verbs and the cause each would be refused with.
contract/actions-line/stale · The actions line · stale — A node that resolves to no element reads stale.
contract/escher-session-commands/actions-answer · escher-session commands · actions answer — actions answers one uncoloured line of JSON {"nodes":[{"id","owner","keyed","verbs":[{"verb","cause"}]}]} on stdout, status 0, the same on the session socket's call, over the mcp role and in a kept check; owner and cause left out when absent.
contract/escher-session-exit-status/0 · escher-session exit status · 0 — Accepted.
contract/escher-session-exit-status/1 · escher-session exit status · 1 — Refused.
contract/escher-session-exit-status/2 · escher-session exit status · 2 — Usage.
contract/escher-session-exit-status/3 · escher-session exit status · 3 — Session error, the recording's record-dir-not-private and recording-failed among them, with no exit of their own.
contract/escher-session-session-error/remedy · escher-session session error object · remedy — A session error's object carries its fixed remedy.
contract/escher-session-stderr/session-error · escher-session stderr · session error — A session error prints its fixed message on stderr.
contract/escher-session-tasks/cells · escher-session tasks · cells — cells is one of the six tasks escher-session serves, listed in its usage line's apps: and the MCP start tool's enum.
contract/escher-session-tasks/counter · escher-session tasks · counter — counter is one of the six tasks escher-session serves, listed in its usage line's apps: and the MCP start tool's enum.
contract/escher-session-tasks/crud · escher-session tasks · crud — crud is one of the six tasks escher-session serves, listed in its usage line's apps: and the MCP start tool's enum.
contract/escher-session-tasks/flight-booker · escher-session tasks · flight-booker — flight-booker is one of the six tasks escher-session serves, listed in its usage line's apps: and the MCP start tool's enum.
contract/escher-session-tasks/load · escher-session tasks · load — load is one of the six tasks escher-session serves, listed in its usage line's apps: and the MCP start tool's enum.
contract/escher-session-tasks/timer · escher-session tasks · timer — timer is one of the six tasks escher-session serves, listed in its usage line's apps: and the MCP start tool's enum.
decision/escher-session-agent-read-surface · escher-session is read by an agent, not a person — An escher-session command prints one line of JSON on stdout, the answer, the refusal or a session error's object keyed by the driver schema's own words, and nothing else there.
contract/escher-session-stderr/usage-error · escher-session stderr · usage error — A usage error prints one fixed line on stderr with stdout empty.
contract/escher-session-tasks/unknown-task · escher-session tasks · unknown task — An unknown task is a usage ending.

## surface-cli · ## Surface: cli
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/0 · escher-session exit codes · 0 — The command was accepted.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/1 · escher-session exit codes · 1 — The command was refused.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/2 · escher-session exit codes · 2 — A usage error.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/3 · escher-session exit codes · 3 — A session error; an mcp role ending in Err also exits 3.
contract/escher-session-stdout/command-line-line · escher-session stdout · command line output — One JSON line per command: the answer, the refusal or a session error's object.

overview/surface-web-spa — The web-spa surface is WASM pages rendering into a canvas: on wasm32 the dioxus-native surface is a canvas appended to the page body and sized from host CSS, so a page such as todomvc fills the window with that canvas.
