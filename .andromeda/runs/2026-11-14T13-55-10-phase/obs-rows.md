## 2-telemetry-strategy · ## 2. Telemetry Strategy · twin telemetry-strategy
decision/escher-crates-always-trace · Escher crates take tracing unconditionally — The escher telemetry and driver crates take tracing with no feature, so the startup and panic events and the command span are always compiled into the seven_guis package's two native binaries, while their engine features stay off in a package-alone build.
decision/telemetry-via-tracing · Telemetry through the tracing crate — Telemetry is the tracing crate's event and span macros; the engine and upstream crates compile their log sites only with the tracing cargo feature, each call a no-op when the feature is off.

## telemetry-strategy · ## 2. Telemetry Strategy · twin 2-telemetry-strategy
decision/escher-crates-tracing-ungated · escher crates take tracing ungated — escher-telemetry and escher-driver take tracing with no feature gate, so the startup and panic events and the driver's spans are always compiled into the binaries that use them.
decision/tracing-for-telemetry · tracing as the telemetry crate — Telemetry is written with the tracing crate's event macros and span macros.

## 3-observability-harness-contract · ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/answers-echo-nothing-typed · Answers echo nothing the caller typed — No answer, refusal, usage line or session error writes back anything the caller typed, and a password's or a file input's value appears only as the fixed mask.
decision/debug-types-never-logged · Answer-bearing types never logged — Types that derive Debug and hold ids, accessible names, control values or page text are never logged, fielded or printed with Debug; a command's outcome is written in one place, as the command's answer.
decision/driver-library-installs-no-subscriber · Driver library installs no subscriber — The driver library, its command line, MCP server and coverage reader included, installs no subscriber and reads no environment variable; only a binary's own main installs the sink.
decision/one-span-per-command · One span per driver command — Each driver command opens exactly one command span, which writes only where a process has installed a sink at info or below.
decision/replay-children-uninstrumented · Replay children uninstrumented — A judged check is replayed on further escher-session mcp children spawned directly, without --record, with stderr to /dev/null. · why: uninstrumented by design
contract/command-answer/shot · driver command answer · shot — A screenshot answer holds width, height and the PNG; over MCP it is an image block followed by the JSON line without the PNG, and is never logged or fielded.
contract/escher-session-stdout/command-answer · escher-session stdout · command answer — Each command's answer, refusal or session-error object is one uncoloured line of JSON on stdout, an answer and never a log line; the host role ends quiet.
contract/kept-check/accepted · kept check file · accepted — Each answered call records whether it was accepted.
contract/kept-check/answer · kept check file · answer — Each answered call records the answer itself, a screenshot's without the PNG.
contract/kept-check/answer-digest · kept check file · answer digest — Each answered call records its answer's FNV-1a 64 digest.
contract/kept-check/arguments · kept check file · arguments — Each answered call's arguments are written into the kept check, a file at rest, never a log line, field or print.
decision/cold-agent-record-owner-only · Cold-agent record directory owner-only — The live session runs mcp --record into target/cold-agent/record/, made owner-only (mkdir -m 700).
decision/headless-stand-no-sink · Headless stand runs with no sink — A headless boot made in process installs no telemetry subscriber and reads no environment variable; a headless boot made by the escher-session binary runs under that binary's sink. · except: The MCP tools check installs its own in-process recording subscriber, and the command-span check's two re-run children install escher's sink over an in-memory capture.
decision/part-answer-never-logged · A part's answer is never logged — A part's answer ({"text":…,"part":n,"parts":m}) is a command's answer, written over MCP as its JSON line, and is never logged or fielded.
decision/session-id-record-unprinted · Session id record kept private — The session's record of the ids its screens have read is bounded, has no reader outside the driver crate and no Debug, and is never printed, logged or fielded.
contract/mcp-role-exit-status/3 · escher-session mcp role exit status · 3 — The server ended on an error, or a record directory was refused before serving; the fixed message is on stderr and stdout is empty.

## 4-span-trace-coverage · ## 4. Span / Trace Coverage · twin span-trace-coverage
decision/driver-emits-no-event · Driver emits no event and installs no subscriber — escher-driver emits no log event and installs no subscriber; its telemetry is its spans alone.
decision/driver-spans-carry-no-content · Driver spans carry no content — escher-driver's spans field only closed words, bools and counts, never the screen text, any argument, a shot byte, a lint finding, a part number, or any Command, Call, ArgValue, Outcome, Refusal or Fault.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/added · escher-driver command span · added — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/busy · escher-driver command span · busy — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/cause · escher-driver command span · cause — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/changed · escher-driver command span · changed — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/passes · escher-driver command span · passes — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/removed · escher-driver command span · removed — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/settled · escher-driver command span · settled — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/span · escher-driver command span · command — Every call handed to Session::run opens one INFO span named command at target escher_driver.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/verb · escher-driver command span · verb — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.

## span-trace-coverage · ## 4. Span / Trace Coverage · twin 4-span-trace-coverage
decision/command-span-no-call-content · No call content in the command span — The command span never fields an argument, an id, the screen text, an accessible name, an image or its size, lint findings, graph content, the session label, or any command, call, outcome or refusal value. · why: An argument fielded by its schema name, or a command or outcome fielded with Debug, would print an id, typed text, an accessible name or a control's value. · guard: stand_act_spans
decision/hosted-call-through-session-run · Hosted call runs through the session's run alone — A hosted part read runs through the session's run alone, so its spans are command spans recording verb alone. · why: stand_act_spans pins a part read's command line carrying its verb alone, and the session host answers each call through Session::run with no span of its own
contract/command-span/added · The driver's command span · added — The length of the returned diff's added list, recorded from an acting verb's outcome.
contract/command-span/busy · The driver's command span · busy — One of three busy-class words, the schema's word for the busy class, recorded from an acting verb's outcome when the outcome carries one.
contract/command-span/cause · The driver's command span · cause — Recorded at one site for every refusal the run returns: one of eight fixed cause names, class words holding nothing a call supplied.
contract/command-span/changed · The driver's command span · changed — The length of the returned diff's changed list, recorded from an acting verb's outcome.
contract/command-span/passes · The driver's command span · passes — Settle's pass count, recorded from an acting verb's outcome when settle answered quiet; on a step that waited on a load, the settle that went quiet.
contract/command-span/removed · The driver's command span · removed — The length of the returned diff's removed list, recorded from an acting verb's outcome.
contract/command-span/settled · The driver's command span · settled — Recorded from an acting verb's outcome only; snapshot, screenshot, lint, graph, actions and a part read record verb alone, and a refusal records verb and cause alone.
contract/command-span/span · The driver's command span · span — One span per call handed to the session's run, target escher_driver, name command, level INFO, entered before validation and held until the run returns, so a refusal is inside it.
contract/refusal-cause/covered · Refusal cause names · covered — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by the executor.
contract/refusal-cause/disabled · Refusal cause names · disabled — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by the executor.
contract/refusal-cause/fonts-unavailable · Refusal cause names · fonts-unavailable — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by the executor before anything is painted when the held app has no font it can paint text with.
contract/refusal-cause/malformed · Refusal cause names · malformed — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by validation.
contract/refusal-cause/not-found · Refusal cause names · not-found — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by the executor.
contract/refusal-cause/off-screen · Refusal cause names · off-screen — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by the executor; an element screenshot that crops to no pixel is refused off-screen.
contract/refusal-cause/stale · Refusal cause names · stale — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by the executor.
contract/refusal-cause/unknown-verb · Refusal cause names · unknown-verb — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by validation.

## 6-log-coverage · ## 6. Log Coverage · twin log-coverage
decision/escher-session-fixed-diagnostics · escher-session diagnostics are fixed strings — Every escher-session diagnostic is a fixed string holding no path, label, id or value, and no ending holds anything the caller typed.
decision/sink-target-allowlist · Sink target allowlist — escher's sink applies an allowlist of targets in its formatter: an engine target prints only the safe fields, the rest [redacted]; an escher_ target prints every field but the content-named set; any other target is dropped whole, not an empty line, at every level and whatever RUST_LOG names. · why: The accepted cost is that a third-party WARN or ERROR never reaches stderr, at any setting. · guard: telemetry_drop · except: The upstream apps' fmt::init() stdout subscribers and the WPT runner's env_logger stay unscrubbed.
contract/escher-driver-span-lines/default-level · escher-driver span lines · default warn level — The driver's command and tool_call span lines print only in a process that installs escher's sink at info or below; at the default warn there is no line.
contract/escher-log-line/span-on-close-only · escher's sink log line · span line timing — A span line is written only when a span whose target the allowlist admits closes, never when it is created, recorded to, entered or exited; an event's line is unchanged inside a span.
contract/escher-sink-env/rust-log · escher's sink configuration · RUST_LOG — Per-module levels come from RUST_LOG through EnvFilter, defaulting to warn when unset or unparsable.
contract/escher-telemetry-events/panic · escher-telemetry events · panic — ERROR at target escher_telemetry::panic, message panic, fields panic.file, panic.line, panic.column and panic.payload (redacted), once per panic.

## log-coverage · ## 6. Log Coverage · twin 6-log-coverage
decision/actions-read-changes-nothing · Actions read changes nothing in the document — The actions read acts on nothing and changes nothing in the document. · why: stand_actions' the_read_changes_nothing_and_holds_no_typed_text_or_mask pins no change mark, unchanged snapshot, focus and empty diff
decision/capability-statement-updated-by-hand · Capability statement updated by hand — A change to the driver's span set or to the scrub's limits is made in the published capability statement by hand. · why: The statement's pin reads none of its emitter claims.
decision/fixed-diagnostics · Fixed diagnostics — Every escher-session diagnostic is a fixed string holding no path, label, id or value, and no ending holds anything the caller typed.
contract/command-span/actions · The driver's command span · actions — An actions line is `span="command" verb="actions"` (with `cause` when refused, an argument refused `malformed`) and holds no node, id, owner, verb word or cause word of its answer.
contract/command-span/field-count · The driver's command span · field count — The `command` span keeps its eight fields; the driver's fixed help and meaning texts add no log site or span field.
contract/command-span/line · The driver's command span · line — One closed-span line per command run, INFO at target `escher_driver`, `span="command"`, with the recorded ones of `verb`, `cause`, `settled`, `busy`, `passes`, `added`, `removed`, `changed`; no line at the default `warn`.
contract/command-span/verb · The driver's command span · verb — The verb table's own word for a known verb, run or refused, one of its fourteen words; never the caller's verb text; unrecorded for a verb the table lacks; the three session-level words and the tool-level help appear only beside the cause unknown-verb.
contract/escher-session-commands/open-recording-directory · escher-session commands · recording directory open to group or others — `start` ends with status 3 and nothing spawned, and `mcp --record` with status 3, its fixed message on stderr and stdout empty.
contract/host-wire/v3 · The escher-session host wire · v3 — Wire version `v3` carries `hello`, `stop` and `call`.
decision/closed-span-lines · Closed spans as a second record class — The sink writes one line for each closed span whose target the allowlist admits, and no line when a span is created, recorded to, entered or exited. · why: Ratified as a boundary widening of the log record classes.
decision/coverage-line-never-logged · Coverage line never logged — The handler coverage line is a command line answer only, never logged or fielded; each replayed step of a kept check writes its own command span line. · guard: a_coverage_run_logs_no_id_no_name_and_nothing_of_its_check_at_trace
contract/command-span/screenshot · The driver's command span · screenshot — A shot's line is `span="command" verb="screenshot"` (with `cause` when refused) and holds no image byte, size or dimension.
contract/escher-session-error-object/remedy · escher-session's error object · remedy — The error object carries a fixed `remedy` beside `kind` and `message`.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/0 · escher-session exit codes · 0 — Accepted: one line of JSON on stdout, stderr empty with `RUST_LOG` unset; also `help`, the host role's quiet end and the `mcp` role's `Ok` end.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/1 · escher-session exit codes · 1 — Refused: one line of JSON on stdout, stderr empty with `RUST_LOG` unset.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/2 · escher-session exit codes · 2 — Usage: one fixed line on stderr built from `VERBS` and the six task names, stdout empty.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/3 · escher-session exit codes · 3 — Session error: the error object on stdout and its fixed message on stderr.
contract/escher-session-stderr/telemetry-not-installed · escher-session's stderr · telemetry not installed — The binary's one direct stderr print is `telemetry not installed: …`.
contract/host-wire/recording-failed · The escher-session host wire · recording-failed — A call after which the host's recording ended is answered by the one fixed reply `recording-failed`.

## 7-error-capture-reporting · ## 7. Error Capture & Reporting · twin error-capture-reporting
decision/no-file-loads-from-non-file-documents · No file: loads from non-file: documents — A file: load asked by a non-file: document is refused as a typed forbidden error: a script fetch rejects with a TypeError, a module import fails, a script element's source is recorded as a script error, and an engine sub-resource fetch fails with fixed text naming no URL or path, adding no log site.
contract/escher-telemetry-panic-hook/previous-hook · escher-telemetry panic hook · previous hook — The hook takes the previous hook, logs its ERROR event, then runs the previous hook, so std's default still prints the raw message to stderr and the exit code is unchanged.

## pii-scrubbing-compliance · ## 8. PII Scrubbing & Compliance · twin 8-pii-scrubbing-compliance
decision/session-logs-carry-no-page-content · Session logs carry no page content — The session host's, the mcp role's and every client's stderr carries no element id, accessible name, typed text, recording path or recorded content at any log level, under the package-alone and the workspace build. · guard: host_log, mcp_log
decision/shot-image-leaves-only-in-answer · Shot image leaves only in its answer — A shot's image is screen content that leaves only in the command's answer, never on a log line. · guard: host_log, mcp_log
contract/actions-answer/cause · the actions answer (actions) · cause — A closed cause word, left out when absent.
contract/actions-answer/content · the actions answer (actions) · content — Carries ids, owner ids, the table's verb words, closed cause words and booleans only, never a value, typed text, mask or NodeId; a boundary widening, ratified.
contract/actions-answer/logging · the actions answer (actions) · logging — The answer is kept whole in a recorded check and is never logged or fielded.
contract/actions-answer/owner · the actions answer (actions) · owner — Left out when the node has no owner.
contract/actions-answer/shape · the actions answer (actions) · shape — Written as {"nodes":[{"id":…,"owner":…,"keyed":…,"verbs":[{"verb":…,"cause":…}]}]}.
decision/driver-span-fields-print · Driver span fields tool and ending print — The tool_call span's fields tool and ending are not in the content-named set and print. · why: both are closed words; the closed-span line was ratified

## 9-ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin ci-integration
decision/local-state-never-uploaded · Local state stays local — The agent-run and cold-agent state, a session's state directory and a recording directory stay local and are uploaded by no CI leg.

## ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin 9-ci-integration
decision/recording-bounds · Recording bounds — A recording ends on a failed write or a passed bound of 400 records or 1,048,576 bytes, and only then does the recorder remove it; escher otherwise never removes a recording.
decision/recording-dir-private · Recording directory private — A recording directory is created 0700 with its parent existing and is refused when open to its group or others; it holds call content at rest and never a log or event line; recording is unix only.
contract/record-refusals/record-dir-not-private · Session recording refusals · record-dir-not-private — A recording directory open to its group or others is refused with record-dir-not-private.
contract/recording-file/answer · The recording file · answer — Each call's answer is kept whole as the line the driver wrote, masked as on every carrier, with its accepted flag and digest; a shot's answer is held as width and height without png.
contract/recording-file/check-file · The recording file · check-{n}.json — Each recorded session gets one check-{n}.json, mode 0600, created new and never replaced, rewritten whole after every call through a temporary file and a rename.
contract/recording-file/typed-text · The recording file · typed text — Typed text is held unmasked, except a type to a masked or unresolved control, held as masked.

overview/telemetry-strategy — Telemetry is the tracing crate's event macros and, in escher-driver, two hand-built spans, command and tool_call. In the engine and upstream crates tracing is compiled in only with the tracing cargo feature. escher-telemetry takes tracing with no feature and always compiles its startup and panic events into the two native binaries, seven_guis_native and escher-session. escher-driver takes tracing ungated, so its spans are written in escher-session through its host, mcp and coverage roles, and by no code path in the windowed seven_guis_native.
