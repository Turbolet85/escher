# test-plan · the rows that bind 2026-11-14-auto-exploration — picked 184 of 603 (106 by every draw) · rule any · pin 922

## 1-test-scope-summary · ## 1. Test Scope Summary · twin test-scope-summary
decision/driver-executor-integration-tested · Driver executor tested by integration checks — The driver's executor verbs, its refusals and the session lint are tested by integration checks, not unit tests. · why: the driver crate depends on nothing that names a virtual DOM, so a unit test cannot build a held instance
decision/native-platform-ci-matrix · Native platform CI matrix — CI tests on windows and macos and only builds on ios and android; linux is tested by the fast test leg, not the matrix.
decision/dedicated-headless-test-harness · Dedicated headless test harness — Blitz documents are tested headlessly through a dedicated, unpublished harness crate.
decision/one-test-target-per-behaviour · One integration test target per behaviour — The integration test crate keeps one test-target file per behaviour, beside shared modules that are no target. · why: differs from upstream, whose layout is one all target · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest

## test-scope-summary · ## 1. Test Scope Summary · twin 1-test-scope-summary
decision/blitz-tests-one-target-per-file · One blitz-tests target per file — The blitz-tests manifest holds one test target per file, with upstream's all target left unbuilt. · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest
decision/driver-instance-verbs-tested-by-stand · Driver verbs over a held instance tested by integration — The driver's executor verbs and its readings over a held instance are covered by integration checks, not unit tests, and its JSON writer's node rows are unit-tested over plain parts. · why: The driver crate depends on nothing that names a virtual DOM, so a unit test cannot build a held instance.
decision/eight-refusal-causes-in-order · Eight refusal causes in a fixed order — The driver's refusal causes are eight, named in a fixed order with `fonts-unavailable` last, each stating its meaning and a distinct remedy, and a refusal reads as its cause's name, then its remedy. · why: Ratified. · guard: the_eight_causes_are_named_in_order
decision/no-screenshot-step-in-committed-checks · No screenshot step in a committed check — A committed recorded check holds no screenshot step; screenshot repeatability is asserted on one host only. · why: a shot's PNG bytes differ between linux x86_64 and macOS aarch64, so a shot is byte-identical on one host only · guard: stand_screenshot_repeat
decision/one-virtual-clock · One virtual clock drives engine time — The scrollbar fade, double-click timing and smooth scroll move only with the document's clock, which a session moves by advance alone; a document built with no clock runs by the wall clock. · why: ratified · guard: virtual_clock_engine, stand_virtual_clock
decision/owner-only-session-files · Owner-only session socket and recordings — A session's state directory is 0700 and its socket 0600, and a recording directory open to its group is refused with nothing written. · guard: stand_session_lifecycle, stand_session_recording
decision/stand-checks-in-both-layout-modes · Stand checks run in both layout modes — A stand check that reads a screen asserts its readings in both layout modes, and the two modes' readings are held equal where the check compares them.
decision/typed-password-never-leaves · A typed password never leaves the instance — A typed password reads only as the fixed mask and occurs in no snapshot, snapshot text, diff, accessibility-tree field, recording, span field, MCP result or screenshot pixels. · guard: stand_snapshot_state, stand_act_filled, stand_mcp_masked, stand_session_recording, password_painted_masked
contract/driver-command-span/one-line-per-call · driver command span · command line — Each call run through the session leaves exactly one escher_driver line at INFO, its span reading command, carrying no field outside the stated eight and none of the ids, names or supplied texts.
contract/escher-session-stderr/no-ids-names-or-typed-text · escher-session stderr · ids, names and typed text — Even at trace level, stderr holds no stable id, no accessible name, no typed text and no screenshot bytes.
contract/session-recording/group-open-directory · session recording · group-open directory — A recording directory open to its group is refused before anything runs.
decision/advance-moves-exactly-the-ms-asked · Advance moves exactly the time asked — An advance reports exactly the ms asked whatever the step does: the step is handed exactly ms, advanced_ms equals ms, and the clock moves by exactly ms. · why: ratified · guard: stand_act_timer
decision/advance-reports-exact-ms · Hosted advance reports exactly the ms asked — A hosted advance moves the timer session with no sleep, and every ask reports exactly the milliseconds asked. · why: Ratified. · guard: host_timer
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/2 · escher-session exit codes · 2 — An argv that is no command ends as a usage error, its usage line holding nothing the caller typed, nothing booted and no state created.
contract/escher-session-exit-codes/3 · escher-session exit codes · 3 — A session error: a host that cannot serve, no session, or a state directory too long, the message holding no path.
contract/mcp-server/help · MCP server · help — help is answered before any start and reads the same bytes through MCP and through the command line.
contract/session-recording/same-check-on-both-surfaces · session recording · same check on both surfaces — The command line and the mcp role keep the same check byte for byte, the state directory gone after stop.

## 2-test-strategy · ## 2. Test Strategy · twin test-strategy
decision/recorded-checks-replayed-as-tests · Recorded checks replayed as tests — A check a session recorded is committed as data and run as an ordinary cargo test target, every step re-validated through the session and red at the first step whose acceptance or kept answer differs.
decision/stand-checks-bundled-font-no-skip · Stand checks on the bundled font, no skip — The headless-stand checks have no skip path and assert unconditionally under the bundled DejaVu Sans with system fonts off.
contract/driver-refusals/fonts-unavailable · Driver refusals · fonts-unavailable — A shot of a document whose font context resolves no sans-serif family is refused with nothing painted and no skip path, and the actions read names the same fonts-unavailable for screenshot.
decision/cross-os-checks-hold-no-shot · Cross-OS byte comparisons hold no shot — A check compared byte for byte across OSes holds no shot. · why: a shot's PNG bytes differ between OSes
decision/recorded-checks-kept-fresh · Recorded checks kept fresh — A committed recorded check is kept fresh by a byte-for-byte comparison with what the binary records. · guard: seven_guis recording
decision/seven-guis-cli-targets-unix-only · seven_guis command-line targets gated to unix — seven_guis' command-line and shell-flow test targets are gated to unix.

## test-strategy · ## 2. Test Strategy · twin 2-test-strategy
decision/stand-checks-bundled-font · Stand checks under a bundled font — The headless-stand checks have no skip path and assert unconditionally under the bundled DejaVu Sans, with system fonts off. · guard: stand_bundled_font_families · except: The pre-existing font-dependent tests skip at runtime when no usable font is available.
decision/capability-claims-name-their-checks · Capability claims name their checks — The capabilities document ends naming the check behind each claim it makes, and states each limit as pinned by its check or as asserted by no check.
decision/cli-and-flow-targets-unix-gated · Command-line and flow targets unix-gated — The command-line check target and the shell flow target are gated to unix; the recording target is gated to unix item by item, beside an off-unix check that runs elsewhere.
decision/cross-os-readings-by-answer-digest · Cross-OS readings of the served tasks — The six served tasks are read on every CI OS by one stand check that compares the driver's answer digests for snapshot (every part), lint and actions, at boot and after one acting step in both layout modes, to one committed table, with no shot and no kept check file. · guard: stand_cross_os_readings
decision/no-shot-in-cross-os-byte-checks · No shot in cross-OS byte comparisons — A check compared byte for byte across OSes holds no shot. · why: A shot's PNG bytes differ between linux x86_64 and macOS aarch64.
contract/record-checks-script/rec-directory · The committed checks' recording script · rec directory — Makes its rec directory with mode 0700.

## 3-test-harness-contract · ## 3. Test Harness Contract
decision/closed-spans-logged-as-lines · Closed spans logged as lines — The stand log carries closed spans its allowlist admits as a second record class beside printed events. · why: a boundary widening, ratified, as the obs-plan's log format states
decision/harness-virtual-clock · Harness time is a virtual clock — The harness's time is a virtual clock its documents read, moved by tick and advance_time; screenshot, screenshot_rect, text_contrast and settle never move it. · why: ratified
decision/no-ids-or-names-in-stand-logs · No ids or names in stand logs — The stand binaries' stderr holds no stable id and no accessible name at any level up to trace, and the session host's none of the text typed. · guard: host_log, mcp_log, stand_act_spans
decision/shared-fixtures-in-one-module · Shared fixtures in one module — The fixture boot and hold, and every fixture more than one check reads, are stated once in one fixtures module with no test and no test target, holding no print, tracing call, env read, file, socket, listener or blitz_net. · except: a page with one reader, or whose ids differ, stays in its own check file
decision/telemetry-target-allowlist · Telemetry target allowlist — A record from an engine target prints only its safe fields, one from an escher_ target prints with its content-named fields redacted, and one from any other target is dropped whole, at every level and whatever RUST_LOG names. · guard: telemetry_scrub, telemetry_drop
decision/timer-step-carries-remainder · Timer step carries its remainder — The stand's timer step returns nothing and carries its remainder below one tick across calls, and a driver session moves its clock on every advance. · why: ratified
decision/virtual-time-for-manual-timers · Virtual time for manual timer driving — blitz-vibey-script's virtual time and without_timer_thread serve embedders that drive timers manually, test runners among them.
contract/cli-command/stderr · escher-session commands · stderr — An accepted command's stderr is empty with RUST_LOG unset.
contract/cli-command/stdout · escher-session commands · stdout — A command's stdout is its answer and nothing else: one line of JSON, with no ESC byte.
contract/command-span/verb · command span · verb — verb and tool_call's tool are closed sets of words, help, screenshot and graph among them, added with no span field.
contract/harness-construction/from-vdom · Harness construction · Harness::from_vdom — Harness::from_vdom(vdom, options) builds a Dioxus-backed harness and pumps once, first providing SeededRandom::from_seed(DEFAULT_SEED) as a root context where the vdom's root holds none; a root context the builder gave stands.
contract/harness-input/clipped-click · Harness input helpers · click on a clipped element — A raw click on an element lying outside the padding box of a box that clips it does not land on it.
contract/stand-boot/boot · seven_guis headless stand · stand::boot — stand::boot(LeanTask, HarnessOptions) boots a lean task (Counter, FlightBooker, Timer, Crud) as a fresh VirtualDom over from_vdom, rendering the task in TaskShell.
contract/stand-boot/boot-cells · seven_guis headless stand · stand::boot_cells — stand::boot_cells(HarnessOptions) boots Cells as Task::Cells in TaskShell, with no LeanTask.
contract/stand-boot/boot-load · seven_guis headless stand · stand::boot_load — stand::boot_load(HarnessOptions) boots the load page, TaskShell titled Load, its options' net_provider replaced by the stand's LoadNet and every other field kept.
contract/stand-boot/boot-timer · seven_guis headless stand · boot_timer — boot_timer(HarnessOptions) boots the Timer as a fresh VirtualDom over from_vdom rendering the task in TaskShell, and returns the harness with its TimerTicks.
contract/stand-boot/options · seven_guis headless stand · stand::options — stand::options(incremental) gives the pinned harness options the stand boots with.
contract/stand-boot/timer-step · seven_guis headless stand · stand::timer_step — stand::timer_step(TimerTicks) is the time step a driver Session on the Timer takes through with_time, with TIMER_TICK_MS (100) as its tick.
contract/stand-log/command-span · Stand log · command span — escher-session's host role writes one closed command span line under escher_driver per call it runs through Session::run, the same with a recording held.
contract/stand-log/span-line · Stand log · span line — One line per closed span the allowlist admits: the event prefix, then span={name}, the span's fields in recorded order, message="close", time.busy and time.idle; no line when a span is created, recorded to, entered or exited.
decision/cold-agent-record-private · Cold-agent recordings kept private — The live server's kept checks sit in an owner-only record directory and are never printed, copied or committed; the parsed check file is never printed.
contract/agent-run-selection/name · agent-run run selection · {name} — {name} runs one file, matching ^[a-z0-9_]+$ with tests/blitz-tests/tests/{name}.rs present; any other selection exits 2.
contract/agent-run-selection/stand · agent-run run selection · stand — stand passes one --test per tests/blitz-tests/tests/stand_*.rs present; with none present it is an empty run, no cargo call, exit 1.
contract/agent-run-selections/all · agent-run selections · run all — Runs every reader of the blitz-tests crate, the stand readers included; there is no `run fixtures` selection.
contract/agent-run-selections/file · agent-run selections · run {file} — Runs one named non-stand reader.
contract/agent-run-selections/stand · agent-run selections · run stand — Runs the `stand_*` readers of the shared module.
contract/agent-run-verbs/boot · agent-run verbs · boot — boot recreates target/agent-run/ with a fresh events.jsonl, builds every blitz-tests test binary (--locked --no-run, output to run.log), writes status.json (booted, boot_ts, head) and emits the boot event; exit 0 ready, 1 failed.
contract/cold-agent-check/step · the cold agent's check · step — A step holds `tool` among the fourteen driver verbs, `arguments` an object and `expect` a list of strings; a check holds at most 400 steps.
contract/cold-agent-tasks/stand · cold-agent pipe tasks · stand — `stand` is the one task: six apps (counter, flight booker, timer, CRUD, cells and the load page) in one client session; any other task, `run counter` included, is a usage error.
contract/harness-construction/from-component · Harness construction · Harness::from_component — Harness::from_component(fn) builds a Dioxus-backed harness and pumps once.
contract/harness-construction/from-html · Harness construction · Harness::from_html — Harness::from_html(html) builds an HTML-backed harness and pumps once.
contract/harness-construction/from-html-with · Harness construction · Harness::from_html_with — Harness::from_html_with(html, HarnessOptions) builds an HTML-backed harness with the given options and pumps once.
contract/harness-core/advance-time · Harness core · advance_time — advance_time(Duration) advances the virtual clock by exactly the duration and then pumps.
contract/harness-core/tick · Harness core · tick — tick(dt) advances the virtual clock by dt and then pumps; a negative or non-finite dt moves nothing.
contract/harness-core/time · Harness core · time — time reads the harness's virtual clock in seconds.
contract/harness-input/input-helpers · Harness input helpers · input helpers — Each input helper (click, tap, drag, press, type_text, wheel_at, scroll_into_view, ime and the rest) pumps after dispatch.

## unit-test-strategy · ## 4. Unit Test Strategy · twin 4-unit-test-strategy
decision/one-actionable-rule · One actionable rule for both readers — Both actionable readers read one rule from an element's current listeners, never from the `data-dioxus-id` mark. · why: The mark outlives a listener removed on a re-render, so a reading of it would still count that listener. · guard: a_listener_removed_on_a_re_render_is_read_by_neither_reader
decision/session-error-messages-fixed · Session error messages are fixed text — Every session error message is a non-empty fixed string holding no `/` and no exit code; the input-or-output arm adds only the kind's name and is spelled «input or output», since «I/O» holds a `/`.
contract/driver-cli/refused-line · Driver command line · refused line — A command line that is no command, or that the schema refuses, runs nothing.
contract/driver-json/masked-value · Driver JSON answers · masked value — A masked node value is written as `MASKED_VALUE`.
contract/driver-verbs/level-check · Driver verbs · level check — A verb is checked at its own level only: a session-level verb given as an instance call is refused `unknown-verb` before its arguments are read; the session commands and `help` are admitted at session level, an argument to `help` refused `malformed`.
contract/driver-verbs/lookup · Driver verbs · lookup — A verb is found by its exact name only; a name differing in case or padding finds nothing.
contract/driver-verbs/verb-table · Driver verbs · verb table — Fourteen verbs in a stated order at three levels — `instance`, `session`, `tool` — each with help, arguments and at least one result field.
contract/refusal-causes/cause-set · Refusal causes · cause set — A closed set of eight causes in a stated order, `fonts-unavailable` the eighth; each name, meaning and remedy is a fixed text, the remedies pairwise distinct and no `/` in any.
contract/refusal-causes/printed-form · Refusal causes · printed form — A refusal's printed form opens with its cause's name and ends with its remedy.
contract/snapshot-node/clickable · Snapshot node · clickable — `clickable` is true where the element's current listeners hold `click` and it is no disabled form control.
contract/coverage-role/unreadable-check · The coverage role · unreadable check — A missing file, a non-check, a check past its bound and another app's check are each refused `malformed`.
contract/driver-argument-kinds/name · Driver argument kinds · ArgKind::Name — A name argument is 1 to 32 bytes of `a-z`, `0-9` and `-`.
contract/driver-argument-kinds/part · Driver argument kinds · ArgKind::Part — A part argument is a whole number from 1 to `MAX_PART`, 1000.
contract/driver-json/number · Driver JSON answers · number — A number is written as its shortest decimal, and as `null` when not finite.

## 5-integration-test-strategy · ## 5. Integration Test Strategy · twin integration-test-strategy
decision/host-stderr-no-screen-content · Host stderr carries no screen content at trace — A host that installs escher's sink, the `mcp` role and a recording session's clients write no id, name or typed text on stderr at `trace`, a paged part read included. · guard: host_log
decision/no-wall-time-in-session-checks · No wall time in session checks — Session checks hold no sleep and no wall-clock read; a check waits on a load through the driver's load wait, and the Timer flow advances by the driver only. · except: The checks whose subject is wall time: the virtual-clock check's 800 ms sleep, the load-wait check's clock reads and stand-in sleep, and the lifecycle check's wait on the host's idle expiry.
decision/session-writes-no-screen-content · Session writes nothing of the screen — The session library and the harness path write nothing of the screen (typed text, a stable id, an accessible name) to stdout, to stderr or into the state directory.
contract/driver-log/per-call-line · the driver's log line · per-call line — With escher's sink at `info`, each call run through the session leaves exactly one `escher_driver` line of fixed words and counts only, none of the ids, names, values or typed text it handled.
contract/driver-session/held-state · driver session · held state — One session booted through the stand holds state across commands and reads as a fresh boot, in both layout modes.
contract/driver-session/password · driver session · typed password — A password typed through the driver never leaves in an answer or as pixels.
contract/driver-session/refused-call · driver session · refused call — A refused call leaves the instance unchanged and reads as a text holding none of the bytes the call supplied.
contract/driver-session/run · driver session · run — A call run through the session returns after settle with the diff of the snapshots taken before and after it.
contract/driver-verbs/actions · driver verbs · actions — `actions` lists each served screen's actionable nodes with the table's verbs, every listed cause being what the call returns, in both layout modes, and changes nothing.
decision/recorded-dispatch-bypasses-document · Recorded dispatch bypasses document handling — Harness input reaches the document through its real event-dispatch pipeline without a window, while recorded dispatch bypasses document-specific handling such as Dioxus forwarding. · why: pointer_leave, touch_events and range_input_interaction read event names through dispatch_recorded while other checks drive the real pipeline through dispatch
contract/driver-log/default-level · the driver's log line · default level — At the default level the driver writes no line.

## integration-test-strategy · ## 5. Integration Test Strategy · twin 5-integration-test-strategy
decision/actions-answer-holds-no-value · Actions answer holds no value — An actions answer carries ids, owner ids, the table's verb words, cause words and booleans only, never a value, never a masked value and no internal node id field. · guard: stand_actions
decision/driver-log-fixed-words-only · Driver log lines hold fixed words and counts only — At `info` each call run through `Session::run` leaves exactly one `escher_driver` line of fixed words and counts, never the ids, names, values or typed text it handled; at the default level no driver line. · guard: stand_act_spans
decision/no-sleep-or-wall-clock-in-checks · No sleep or wall-clock read in checks — Session checks take no sleep and read no wall clock; time moves by `advance` alone. · except: stand_virtual_clock's 800 ms sleep, stand_load_wait's clock reads and 200 ms stand-in sleep, stand_session_lifecycle's idle-expiry wait and stand_contrast's bound on a load's answer.
decision/refusal-leaves-instance-unchanged · Refusals change nothing and echo no input — A refused call leaves the instance unchanged and reads as a text holding none of the bytes the call supplied.
decision/session-logs-no-screen-content · Session logs nothing of the screen — The session library, the session host and its mcp role write no typed text, stable id, accessible name or shot bytes to stdout, stderr or the state directory, at any log level. · guard: stand_session_quiet, host_log, mcp_log
decision/start-in-state-reads-as-by-hand-path · Start in a state held to its by-hand path — A session started in a named fixture state reads, in both layout modes, as that state reached by hand from boot and takes the next call as the by-hand session does; an unknown name is refused with the session reading as boot. · guard: stand_start_in_state
decision/typed-password-never-returned · Typed passwords never returned — A password typed through the driver occurs nowhere in what the call returns, reads `MASKED_VALUE`, and never leaves as pixels in a screenshot. · guard: stand_act_screenshot, stand_act_filled
contract/refusal-cause/covered · driver refusal causes · covered — A target a hit at its centre does not reach is refused `covered`; the fixed meaning also says an option of a closed select lies under it, to click the select first and then the option.
contract/refusal-cause/disabled · driver refusal causes · disabled — A call on a disabled target is refused `disabled`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/off-screen · driver refusal causes · off-screen — A target outside its scrolling box's view, or an element shot cropping to no pixel, is refused `off-screen`, the instance unchanged.
contract/session-errors/alreadyrunning · session errors · AlreadyRunning — Returned by start while a session is already up.
contract/session-run/diff · escher_driver Session · run — A call run through `Session::run` on a held session returns after settle with the diff of the snapshots taken before and after it.
contract/session-run/type · escher_driver Session · type — A `type` replaces what a filled control holds and an empty text clears it; a masked control's written form holds the mask, never the typed text.
contract/session-state-directory/session-sock · the session state directory · session.sock — The state directory holds session.sock alone; a kept recording lives in the launcher's recording directory.
decision/layout-tests-in-both-layout-modes · Layout assertions in both layout modes — Layout assertions run in both layout modes, non-incremental and incremental, as the pipeline tests do. · guard: incremental_oracle · except: Upstream integration targets taken in a sync are kept as written, and those that run one layout mode stand as named exceptions.
decision/load-wait-bound · Acting steps wait out loads in flight — An acting step that meets a load in flight waits for it up to `LOAD_WAIT`, five seconds of wall time, settling again every 10 ms and moving no virtual time; at the bound it ends not settled with `busy` `Loads`. · guard: stand_load_wait
decision/session-refuses-out-of-grammar · Out-of-grammar requests refused — A session request outside the grammar or over the bound is refused with nothing run. · guard: stand_session_lifecycle
contract/actions-command/argument · the actions command · argument — An argument to actions is refused malformed.
contract/refusal-cause/fonts-unavailable · driver refusal causes · fonts-unavailable — A call that needs fonts the instance lacks is refused `fonts-unavailable`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/malformed · driver refusal causes · malformed — A malformed call is refused `malformed`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/not-found · driver refusal causes · not-found — A call naming an id not on the screen is refused `not-found`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/stale · driver refusal causes · stale — A call naming a stale id is refused `stale`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/unknown-verb · driver refusal causes · unknown-verb — A call naming no known verb is refused `unknown-verb`, the instance unchanged.
contract/session-errors/nosession · session errors · NoSession — Returned when a session is reached and none is running.
contract/session-host-stderr/command-span · the session host's stderr · command span — Exactly one command span line is written per call.
contract/session-host-stderr/service-name · session host stderr lines · service.name — Every line the escher-session host writes to stderr carries `service.name=seven_guis`.
contract/session-run/changed-node-states · escher_driver Session · acting call result — An acting call returns the node it changed with its `selected` or `invalid` reading as it reads after the step.
contract/session-run/screenshot · escher_driver Session · screenshot — A `screenshot` returns the screen, or the element its optional id names, as a PNG equal to the harness's raster, and changes nothing.
contract/session-run/type-on-select · escher_driver Session · type on a select — A `type` on a single-choice select chooses the first option whose label starts with the text, its diff naming the select with `value` and the options whose `selected` moved.

## 6-e2e-test-strategy · ## 6. E2E Test Strategy · twin e2e-test-strategy
decision/checks-hold-no-screenshot-step · No screenshot step in committed checks — The scripts behind the committed checks hold no screenshot step. · why: a shot's PNG bytes differ by OS
decision/cli-checks-through-own-binary · Command-line checks through the package's own binary — Each escher-session driver command is run as a process of the package's own binary against a host its start command spawned.
decision/ui-driven-through-session-binary · App UI driven through the session binary — No test in the apps launches a window; the UI is driven through the escher-session binary.
decision/checks-byte-equal-to-recording · Committed checks byte-equal to the binary's recording — The committed checks are recorded by escher-session and read byte-equal to what the binary records.

## e2e-test-strategy · ## 6. E2E Test Strategy · twin 6-e2e-test-strategy
decision/no-screenshot-in-recorded-check-scripts · No screenshot step in committed recorded checks — The scripts that record the committed checks hold no `screenshot` step, so the kept checks stay byte-equal across operating systems. · why: a shot's PNG bytes differ by OS · guard: the_committed_checks_are_what_the_binary_records
contract/cli-record/permissions · escher-session CLI recording · --record — `start <task> --record <dir>` keeps one `0600` check in a `0700` directory; a group-open recording directory is refused, status 3, with nothing spawned.
contract/cli-schema/refused-call · escher-session CLI schema · refused call — A call the schema refuses reaches no session.
contract/cli-actions/output · escher-session CLI actions verb · output — `actions` against a started host answers one JSON line of the actionable nodes.
contract/cli-coverage-role/stdout · escher-session CLI coverage role · coverage line — Replaying a kept check prints the handlers it left in one coverage line on stdout, status 0.
contract/cli-exit-codes/1 · escher-session CLI exit codes · 1 — A call a target cannot take is refused with its cause.
contract/cli-exit-codes/3 · escher-session CLI exit codes · 3 — A session error: a command that finds no session, a state directory too long, or a group-open recording directory.
contract/command-span/actions · driver command span · actions — An `actions` tool call parents one `command` span that records `verb` alone.
contract/mcp-actions/argument · escher-session MCP role · actions — The `actions` tool call answers its line of the actionable nodes; an argument to `actions` reads `isError`.
contract/mcp-record/parity · escher-session MCP role · --record — With `--record` the tool listing and `help` are the same bytes as without it, and the kept check is byte-identical to the command line's.

## 7-test-data-fixtures · ## 7. Test Data & Fixtures · twin test-data-fixtures
decision/checks-hold-no-private-data · Committed checks hold no private data — The committed checks hold no typed text, host path or secret.
decision/shared-fixture-pages · Shared fixture pages stated once — A fixture page that more than one check reads is stated once as an rsx component and booted with the stand's options. · except: a page with one reader stays in its check's file
decision/stand-boots-offline · Stand boots offline — Every headless stand boot keeps no network provider, and no real network is used by the stand. · guard: the_stand_options_stay_offline · except: The stand load page's boot, which supplies the self-answering LoadNet stand-in, answering one fixed sheet from its own thread after a delay.
decision/test-data-in-code · Test data stated in code — Test data is stated in code: inline HTML, literals and byte arrays, directly injected images, fixed viewports, embedded fonts and pages generated in the test. · except: one external benchmark page supplied through PAINT_TREE_BENCH_HTML
decision/wrapped-document-keeps-own-clock · Wrapped document keeps the clock its config gave — Documents the harness builds read the harness's virtual clock, while a wrapped document keeps the clock its own config gave it. · why: virtual_clock_engine wraps documents built on their own VirtualClock and moves that clock to time double clicks; the harness-built half is the harness clock rule
decision/harness-counts-fetching-providers-only · Harness counts loads of fetching providers only — Harness documents always use HtmlProvider, and only a fetching net_provider is wrapped in the load counter that settle reads. · why: settle reads in-flight loads off the counter; the settle tests and stand_settle's load-in-flight check rely on a fetching stand-in being wrapped

## test-data-fixtures · ## 7. Test Data & Fixtures · twin 7-test-data-fixtures
contract/committed-checks/excluded-content · committed recorded checks · excluded content — A committed check holds ids, names, values, snapshot text and diffs, and no typed text, host path, secret or screenshot step.
decision/stand-load-page-fixed-answer · Load page stand-in answers after a fixed delay — The stand load page's checks rely on its stand-in network answering the fixed URL with fixed bytes after a fixed delay, every other stand boot having no network provider. · why: stand_load_wait times the driver's wait against LOAD_ANSWER_DELAY, and stand_contrast reads the load-done message once the stand-in answered

## 8-mocking-stubbing-discipline · ## 8. Mocking & Stubbing Discipline · twin mocking-stubbing-discipline
decision/settle-never-advances-time · Settle never advances time — Settle neither advances the timer nor waits on a tick not yet delivered.
decision/stand-pinned-real-font · Stand checks keep a real pinned font — The headless-stand checks use the bundled DejaVu Sans font, decoded through the native woff feature, with system fonts off.
decision/stand-timer-ticks · Stand timer driven by TimerTicks — Every headless-stand boot of a lean task provides TimerTicks in place of the timer's real delay.
decision/font-metric-tests-never-skip · Font-metric tests never skip — A font-metric test takes no skip path: it asserts its text-size precondition and fails rather than skipping. · why: The skip came from the fixture's no-namespace element, not from missing system fonts. · guard: hover_state_tests
decision/network-stand-ins-counted · Network stand-ins keep their loads counted — Network stand-ins do not override is_noop, so the harness counts their loads.

## mocking-stubbing-discipline · ## 8. Mocking & Stubbing Discipline · twin 8-mocking-stubbing-discipline
decision/timer-driven-by-delivered-ticks · Timer driven by delivered ticks — In every headless-stand boot the Timer's real delay is replaced by delivered 100 ms ticks applied on the next pass; settle neither advances the timer nor waits on an undelivered tick. · guard: stand_timer, stand_settle

## 9-ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin ci-integration
decision/font-assertions-on-system-fonts · Font-dependent assertions on system fonts — Font-dependent assertions rely on the system-fonts feature, on by default when the whole workspace is tested. · except: Headless-stand checks use only the bundled DejaVu Sans with system fonts off, so they measure the same on any runner, the package-alone build included.
decision/sink-capture-counted-by-target · Sink capture counted by target — A check that reads a sink's capture counts lines by target, never in total. · why: The workspace test build compiles the engine with tracing on and the per-package build with it off, so engine log lines appear under one runner only.
decision/per-package-green-not-workspace-green · Per-package green is not the workspace green — A green per-package test run is not the workspace test leg's green. · why: The two runs build the same test file against different engine features, tracing and writing-mode on in the workspace build only.

## 10-quality-gates-coverage-targets · ## 10. Quality Gates & Coverage Targets · twin quality-gates-coverage-targets
decision/stand-checks-zero-failure-budget · Zero-failure budget for stand checks — The stand checks, the named stand-repeat targets and seven_guis' process checks run three rounds in CI with no retry, and the first red command ends the leg red. · guard: Stand checks repeated job; test_stand_repeat_leg_runs_three_rounds

## quality-gates-coverage-targets · ## 10. Quality Gates & Coverage Targets · twin 10-quality-gates-coverage-targets
decision/zero-failure-stand-repeat · Zero-failure flakiness budget for stand checks — The stand checks hold a zero-failure budget: the stand_*.rs files, the named blitz-tests targets and seven_guis' process checks run three times with no retry, and any failure fails the leg. · why: Ratified as a repeated job with zero failures. · guard: stand-repeat leg, job Stand checks repeated

## session-lifecycle · key of ## 3. Test Harness Contract
decision/log-silence-read-on-a-sink-host · Log silence read on a host with a sink — A zero read from a host that installs no log sink says nothing about a host that does.
decision/no-screenshot-in-cross-os-checks · No screenshot step in cross-OS byte-compared checks — A check compared byte for byte across OSes, a committed check's digest included, holds no `screenshot` step; the shot path's kept form is covered by the recording test on linux and macOS. · why: A shot's PNG bytes differ between linux x86_64 and macOS aarch64. · guard: stand_session_recording
decision/replay-through-the-call-path · Replay through the ordinary call path — A kept check replays through the session's ordinary call path, whose signature and span stay unchanged, and its result types hold no reading and no JSON-library type. · why: Ratified.
decision/two-clicks-without-advance-double-click · Two clicks with no advance are a double click — Under the virtual clock, two clicks with no `advance` between them are a double click. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_virtual_clock
contract/check-replay/stop · Check replay · stop — Each step's call runs validated again, and the replay stops at the first step whose acceptance differs or whose live kept line is not equal to the kept `answer`, naming the result fields that differ.
contract/driver-session/acting-verbs · Driver session · acting verbs — `click`, `type`, `press`, `advance` and `scroll` are each one settled step that waits on a load in flight and returns the diff of the snapshots before and after; `scroll` adds `in_view`.
contract/driver-session/load-wait · Driver session · LOAD_WAIT — A load in flight is waited for up to 5 s of wall time, settled again every 10 ms, no time moving on the held instance; a failed load ends the wait.
contract/driver-session/refusal-order · Driver session · refusal order — A `click` or `type` on an element that cannot take it is refused with the first that holds of `disabled` · `off-screen` · `covered`, leaving the snapshot and both focus readings as they were.
contract/driver-session/run-carriers · Driver session · run carriers — The instance call path is the one thing a host does with a `call` request and the MCP server with an instance verb's tool call.
contract/driver-session/run-validation · Driver session · run — A call is validated first, and a refused call has run nothing.
contract/driver-session/stale-or-not-found · Driver session · stale · not-found — An id that names no element on the screen as it reads now is refused with nothing run: `stale` when the session's record of read ids holds it, `not-found` when not.
contract/driver-session/start-label · Driver session · Session::start — Takes a label of 1 to 32 bytes of `a-z`, `0-9` and `-`, checked before the caller's boot runs once on the calling thread; an invalid label is `InvalidLabel` with nothing booted.
contract/driver-session/type-replaces · Driver session · type — After the focusing click, where the snapshot reads a value for the target, the driver selects all and types, so an empty text clears the control; a select is focused with no click and no DOM focus event.
contract/session-errors/record-dir-not-private · Session errors · RecordDirNotPrivate — A recording directory open to its group or others.
contract/session-recording/check-file · Session recording · check file — `check-{n}.json` is created `0600`, never replacing a file, and rewritten whole through a `0600` temporary and a rename.
contract/session-recording/check-read · Session recording · Check::from_bytes — A kept check is read strictly, `answer` required as a JSON object; anything else is refused `malformed`.
contract/session-recording/directory · Session recording · directory — Unix only, `Unsupported` elsewhere; the directory is created `0700` or refused `RecordDirNotPrivate`.
contract/session-recording/record-fields · Session recording · record fields — Each answered instance call is recorded as `tool`, `arguments` in schema order, `masked`, `accepted`, `digest` (FNV-1a 64 over the whole written line) and `answer` (the kept line as a JSON object, a shot's without `png`).
decision/advance-moves-clock-exactly · advance moves the clock exactly — Every session accepts `advance`, which moves the session's clock by exactly the asked milliseconds and then runs the caller's time step where one was handed. · why: Ratified.
decision/socket-carries-commands · The socket carries commands — The session socket carries a call's element id and typed text in, and ids, accessible names, control values (a password's or file input's as the fixed mask), the snapshot's text, the diff and lint findings out. · why: Ratified, where until then none of them crossed.
contract/check-replay/another-app · Check replay · another app — A check replayed on a session whose label is not the check's app runs nothing.
contract/driver-session/act · Driver session · act — Runs one step on the held harness and waits for quiet; an instance not quiet is `NotSettled(Busy)`, one still loading at the bound `NotSettled(Loads)`; the step is not rolled back, and nothing it reads or returns crosses the socket.
contract/driver-session/id-record · Driver session · record of ids — Holds id text only, at most 4096 ids, for the session's life, no id longer than `MAX_ID_BYTES`, read by nothing outside the crate.
contract/driver-session/not-settled-result · Driver session · settled — A verb on an instance that did not go quiet is a result, `settled` false with its `busy` class, and is not rolled back.
contract/driver-session/reading-verbs · Driver session · reading verbs — `snapshot`, `screenshot`, `lint` and `graph` run no step and wait on nothing.
contract/driver-session/session-verb-in-run · Driver session · session-level verb — `start`, `status` or `stop` handed to the instance call path is refused `unknown-verb`.
contract/escher-session-command-line/start · escher-session command line · start — `start <task> [--record <dir>]`, the task one of `counter` · `flight-booker` · `timer` · `crud`; with `--record` the recording directory is checked before anything is spawned, a refusal status `3` with nothing spawned.
contract/session-recording/bounds · Session recording · bounds — Past 400 records or 1,048,576 bytes, or on a failed write, the recording ends, its check removed, and the failure reads true once; the call is not rolled back.

## session-lifecycle · key of ## 3. Test Harness Contract
overview/session-lifecycle — The session checks drive one headless app instance held by one process, and a lifecycle another process drives, with the calls it sends, over a Unix-domain socket. The session is not part of the five-command agent-run contract, which starts and binds nothing.
