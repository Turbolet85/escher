## threat-model-summary · ## Threat Model Summary
decision/actions-answer-crossing · Actions answer crossing — An actions answer carries what each actionable node can take now on the socket, the command line, MCP and a kept check: ids, owner ids, keyed booleans, verb-table words and closed cause words, never a control value, typed text or NodeId. · why: A boundary widening, ratified.
decision/coverage-check-files-untrusted · Kept check files read as untrusted — The coverage role reads each caller-named kept check as untrusted input through a bounded read and a strict parse; an unreadable, oversized, non-check or other-app file is refused malformed, holding nothing of the path or the file.
contract/actions-answer/id · The actions answer · id — The node's id.
contract/actions-answer/owner · The actions answer · owner — The node's owner id.
contract/actions-answer/verbs · The actions answer · verbs — A list of entries each holding verb, a word of the verb table, and cause, a closed cause word.
contract/driver-session-reply/masked-control-values · driver session socket replies · control values — A password's or file input's control value is carried masked.
contract/driver-session-reply/no-node-id · driver session socket replies · NodeId — No reply carries a NodeId.
contract/mcp-result/masked-control-values · MCP server results · control values — A password's or file input's control value is carried masked.
decision/file-url-only-for-file-documents · File URLs load only for file documents — A file: URL loads only for a file: document or a top-level load; for any other document, remote pages included, JS fetch, module import and script src refuse it with a FetchError, and blitz-net refuses the engine's stylesheet, @import, font, image and iframe loads before any disk read.

## input-validation · ## Input Validation
decision/accessible-names-not-logged · Accessible names kept out of logs — Escher's own code logs no accessible name, and a host that installs escher's sink writes none to stderr at any `RUST_LOG` level, the third-party record that carried one being dropped whole. · why: That third-party target is outside the sink's allowlist. · guard: mcp_log
decision/actions-keyed-field · Keyed flag in the actions answer — The `actions` verb's answer carries, per actionable node, its id, owner id, a `keyed` boolean and closed verb and cause words, no NodeId. · why: A ratified boundary widening.
decision/actions-read-changes-nothing · Actions read runs nothing and moves no session state — The actions read runs nothing and changes no snapshot, focus reading or diff, so it can be called without moving the session. · why: The stand_actions test the_read_changes_nothing_and_holds_no_typed_text_or_mask pins it; agents call the actions verb between steps over socket and MCP
decision/actions-read-shares-target-check · Actions read and verbs share one target check — Every id-taking verb and the actions read meet one shared target check, so what the actions read lists agrees with what a call would be refused. · why: The stand_actions test every_listed_cause_on_the_lean_tasks_is_what_the_call_returns pins that each listed cause equals the refusal the call returns
decision/anchored-id-tier · Anchored stable-id tier — An unkeyed element's stable id is anchored under the nearest author-keyed element of its own component instance before falling back to its component path or document path. · why: The anchored tier was ratified.
decision/boundary-widening-rule · Boundary widening rule — A new field of a closed value set inside an already ratified carrier is not a boundary widening, while a field holding authored text, an open value set, a new carrier or a new exit still is.
decision/button-click-focuses · A button click focuses the button — A click on a `button` of any type or an `input` of type `submit`, `reset` or `button` focuses it and submits its form owner when it is a submit button, a disabled form control stopping the walk first. · why: An engine change for every document and a boundary widening, ratified.
decision/cli-closed-argv-reader · Closed argv reader — The session command line reads argv with a closed reader with fixed rules, and checks a call before the session address is asked for.
decision/cli-echoes-nothing-typed · Command line echoes nothing typed — No command-line ending writes back anything the caller typed, and no path on argv panics.
decision/closed-driver-verb-schema · Closed driver verb schema — Every driver call is checked against a closed table of verbs and bounded argument kinds and answered with one typed command or one refusal, the first failure in a fixed order; a refused call changes nothing. · why: Each widening of the verb table is a widening of a validated surface, ratified.
decision/closed-pipe-drops-answer · Closed pipe drops the answer — A write to a closed stdout is dropped and the command keeps its exit status, never a panic. · guard: a_closed_stdout_drops_the_answer_and_keeps_the_ending
decision/closed-value-field-no-widening · A closed-value field in a ratified carrier is no widening — A new field of a closed value set inside an already ratified carrier is not a widening and needs no ratification; a field holding authored text, an open value set, a new carrier or a new exit still does. · why: Ratified as the standing rule.
decision/command-schema-no-clock · Command schema reads no clock — The command schema and its validation read no clock.
decision/command-span-content-free · Command span holds no content — One command span per call holds fixed words, booleans and counts only, never a call's content, the screen text, an image or findings.
decision/descriptions-adapter-only · Descriptions cross only to the accessibility adapter — `aria-describedby` targets and `aria-description` text reach only the platform accessibility adapter; the snapshot reads no description, so no driver or MCP carrier, verb, field, log field or span carries one. · why: Upstream's behaviour, ratified as a boundary widening by upstream merge. · guard: accessibility_description
decision/diff-counts-only-in-logs · Only diff sizes reach a log — A diff's content never reaches a log or event, while its three sizes (counts of added, removed and changed nodes) are recorded on the driver's command span, printed at `info` or below. · why: Ratified: a diff's content never reaches a log while its three sizes may.
decision/driver-installs-no-subscriber · Driver installs no subscriber — The driver crate and its command line install no tracing subscriber and read no environment variable; clocks are read only by the host's idle expiry, the MCP server on a request, the session's bounded load wait, and the client's bounded stop and ready waits.
decision/driver-no-subscriber-no-env · Driver installs no subscriber and reads no env — The driver crate and its session command line install no tracing subscriber and read no environment variable.
decision/driver-outcomes-never-logged · Driver outcomes never logged — The driver crate logs and fields no command, call, argument, outcome, refusal, screen text, image, finding, session label or id record; an outcome is written only as a command-line answer, an MCP tool result, a session-socket reply or a recording file the caller asked for. · why: Outcomes leave the process only by the ratified crossing.
decision/driver-type-on-select · Driver type on a select — The driver's type on any select focuses it with no click and no DOM focus events, clears the typeahead, closes any list, and a text opening on a space types nothing. · why: A click on a multiple select would land on the centre row and a Space would flip a row; a boundary widening, ratified.
decision/enter-activates-focused-control · Enter activates the focused control — A pressed `Enter` on the focused node dispatches a click on it when it is no disabled form control and is a `button`, a `summary`, an `input` of type `submit`, `reset` or `button`, or an `a` with `href`. · why: An engine change for every document and a boundary widening, ratified.
decision/fixture-name-closed-table · Fixture state name checked against a closed table — A fixture state name is compared whole against the app's closed table of named states before any session starts; any other name is refused as an unknown state and nothing is booted.
decision/id-lookup-anew-each-call · Caller-supplied id looked up anew — An acting command that takes a caller-supplied id looks it up on the screen as it reads now, on every call, never by index and keeping no node handle between calls; an id that names nothing is refused with nothing run and no panic.
decision/id-record-bounded-and-session-fed · Bounded id record fed by the session — The session keeps no node handle between calls, only a record of at most 4096 id texts fed from its own snapshots and never from a call's argument.
decision/mask-holds-on-every-carrier · Value mask holds on every carrier — A masked value stays masked on every carrier the snapshot reaches: its text form, a diff, the driver's return, the session socket and MCP tool results. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_act_filled, stand_mcp_masked
decision/masked-input-values · Password and file input values masked — A password's or file input's value reads as the fixed `MASKED_VALUE` in the snapshot, its text, diffs and every carrier, never the text, its length or a file's host path. · except: The DOM and form submission keep the value.
decision/no-echo-of-caller-input · No echo of caller input — No command-line ending writes back anything the caller typed: no path, label, id, value or file content.
decision/no-node-id-between-calls · No NodeId kept between calls — No NodeId is kept between calls.
decision/no-panic-on-call-input · No panic on call-supplied input — Neither the driver command schema's validation nor the executor has unwrap, expect, panic or unreachable on anything a call supplies.
decision/no-process-handle-crosses · No process-local handle crosses with an id — Neither the stable id, the snapshot, the diff nor any driver session, answer or refusal carries a `NodeId`, `ElementId`, `ScopeId` or pointer; only the stable id text crosses.
decision/one-actionable-rule · One actionable rule for both readings — The unkeyed-actionable reading and the actionable-nodes reading both read one actionable rule: focusable, an interactive role, or current listeners holding an event other than `mounted`. · why: The actionable test a_listener_removed_on_a_re_render_is_read_by_neither_reader pins it; the driver's actions verb and the unkeyed lint read these readers
decision/one-command-span-per-call · One command span per call — Every call handed to the session is wrapped in one INFO span named command under the escher_driver target, entered before validation so a refusal is inside it, holding fixed words, booleans and counts only.
decision/one-validation-path-for-every-carrier · One validation path for every carrier — The session socket, the command line and MCP each pass a call through the schema's validation before anything runs, and nothing public runs a command that did not come from that validation. · why: The crossing to external input surfaces was ratified with this check as the one they all pass through.
decision/password-file-value-masked · Password and file input values masked — The snapshot reads a password or file input's non-empty value as one fixed marker whatever was typed or chosen, an empty one as empty, never the text, its length or a file's host path. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_act_filled, stand_mcp_masked · except: The DOM is untouched: a file input's value attribute still holds the host path and form submission still carries it.
decision/recorded-check-strict-reader · Recorded check is read strictly as untrusted — A kept check is read as untrusted bytes, at most 1,048,576 bytes and 400 records of closed keys; anything else is refused `malformed` with no fault, holding nothing of the file, with no panic path.
decision/recorded-check-untrusted · Recorded check bytes are untrusted — A kept check is read by a strict reader bounded in bytes and records, with closed keys and schema-named arguments, anything else refused as malformed holding nothing of the file, no panic path; every replayed step is validated again; the coverage role reads checks through the same reader.
decision/recorded-type-masked · Recorded type to a masked control kept masked — A recorded type whose element resolves to a masked control or to none is kept as a stand-in marked masked, never the text, its length or a digest of it, while any other type's text is kept as it crossed. · why: Ratified.
decision/recorder-removes-only-own-files · Recorder removes only its own files — A file the recorder did not create is never removed.
decision/recording-bounds-end-recording · A failed or overlong recording ends — A failed write or a passed bound of 400 records or 1,048,576 bytes ends the recording, its check removed, the call run and not rolled back and answered `recording-failed`.
decision/recording-dir-never-named · Recording directory is never exposed — No tool call, verb, argument or result field names the recording directory, and nothing of it is logged. · why: Ratified.
decision/recording-dir-owner-only · Recording directory is owner-only — The recording directory is created mode 0700 and a present one open to group or others is refused `record-dir-not-private` with status 3, nothing written and nothing spawned. · why: Ratified.
decision/recording-directory-never-named · Recording directory never named or logged — No tool call, verb, argument or result field names the recording directory, and nothing of it is logged.
decision/recording-directory-owner-only · Owner-only recording directory — The recording directory is created 0700, a group- or other-open one is refused with nothing written or spawned, each check is created 0600 and never replaced, and recording is unix only.
decision/recording-ends-on-failure · Recording ends on failure — A failed write or a passed bound ends the recording.
decision/recording-never-replaces-files · Recording never replaces or removes foreign files — A recorded check file is created 0600 with create-new under the smallest free number, rewritten whole through a temp file and rename; no file is replaced and a file the recorder did not create is never removed.
decision/replay-through-session-run · Replay runs each step through the session — A replayed check runs each kept step through the session's own validated run alone, runs nothing on a session of another app and stops at the first step whose acceptance or kept answer differs.
decision/seeded-source-in-process-seed-only · Seeded source takes its seed from in-process code only — The seeded source of randomness takes its seed only from in-process code, a root context the virtual DOM's builder gives else the default seed 0, and outside any run seeds from the host's per-process random keys, reading no environment variable, file or carrier.
decision/select-list-label-never-logged · Select list row labels never logged — The select list's public surface is read-only but for one closing writer, and a list row's label, being page text, is never logged.
decision/session-id-record-bounded · Bounded in-process record of read ids — A session keeps a private record of ids its own snapshots read, at most 4096 ids of at most 1024 bytes each, the oldest forgotten first, read by no public item and written to no log, event, socket or file. · why: Kept to tell the stale and not-found refusals apart. · guard: the_record_holds_no_id_longer_than_a_call_can_name
decision/session-label-only-caller-string · Session label is the one echoed caller string — The session label is never text read from the document and is the one caller string a reply carries.
decision/single-validation-gate · Single command validation gate — Every call, from the socket, the command line or MCP, is checked against a closed static table of verbs and bounded argument kinds, the first failure in a fixed order, and nothing public runs a command that did not come from that validation.
decision/socket-carries-screen-reading · Session socket carries what the screen reads — An answer carries what the screen reads, ids, accessible names, control values with password and file input masked, snapshot text, diff, lint findings, UI graph, never a NodeId or an attribute value as typed. · why: The crossing was ratified.
decision/stable-id-exits · Ratified exits of the stable id — The stable id leaves the process only through the platform accessibility adapter, the driver's answers over the session socket and the client's stdout, MCP tool results on the `mcp` role's stdout, and kept check files. · why: Each carrier ratified as a boundary widening.
decision/stable-id-not-logged · Stable ids kept out of logs — Escher's own code writes the stable id to no log, and a host that installs escher's sink drops third-party style records carrying an element's HTML id whole, printing that value at no `RUST_LOG` level. · why: Those third-party targets are outside the sink's allowlist.
decision/state-dir-deletes-only-own · Session cleanup deletes only its own files — Stopping or idle expiry removes the socket file and then the directory, non-recursively, and nothing else is ever deleted.
decision/state-dir-owner-only · Session state directory is owner-only — The session state directory is created mode 0700 and a present one granting group or others any bit is refused; the socket file is set 0600.
decision/state-dir-path-is-parameter · Session state path is a parameter — The session state directory path is a caller parameter, never read from the environment or defaulted relative to the working directory.
decision/state-directory-path-is-parameter · State directory path is a parameter — The state directory path is a parameter, never an environment read or a working-directory-relative default.
decision/target-refusal-order · Fixed order of target refusals — A click or type on an element that cannot take it is refused with nothing run, the first of disabled, off-screen, covered that holds, leaving the snapshot and both focus readings as they were; scroll reports in_view instead of refusing. · why: The detection of refusal causes by code was ratified.
decision/unknown-id-refused-stale-or-not-found · Unknown id refused as stale or not-found — An id that names no element on the screen as it reads now is refused with nothing run: stale when the session's record of ids holds it, not-found when not.
decision/unknown-target-refused · Call on an unknown or unfit element refused — A call whose id names no element, or an element that cannot take the call, is refused with nothing run.
contract/actions-answer/keyed · The actions answer · keyed — A boolean on each listed node.
contract/actions-answer/nodes · The actions answer · nodes — `{"nodes":[{"id","owner","keyed","verbs":[{"verb","cause"}]}]}`, one entry per actionable node, holding ids, owner ids, `keyed` booleans, verb words and closed cause words, never a control value, typed text or NodeId.
contract/driver-argument-kinds/id · Driver argument kinds · id — Text of 1 to 1024 bytes.
contract/driver-argument-kinds/text · Driver argument kinds · text — Text of 0 to 4096 bytes.
contract/driver-id-refusal/not-found · Driver id refusal · not-found — A call naming an id that no element on the current screen carries is refused as `not-found` when the session's record does not hold that id.
contract/driver-id-refusal/stale · Driver id refusal · stale — A call naming an id that no element on the current screen carries is refused as `stale` when the session's record holds that id.
contract/driver-verbs/actions · Driver verbs · actions — Takes no argument (any argument refused malformed, nothing run), runs no step, and answers {"nodes":[{"id","owner","keyed","verbs":[{"verb","cause"}]}]}, owner and cause left out when absent, never a control value, typed text or NodeId.
contract/masked-input-value/masked-stand-in · Masked input values · MASKED_STAND_IN — A recorded masked `type` is kept as `MASKED_STAND_IN`.
contract/recorded-check/accepted · Recorded check file · accepted — One of the closed record keys, whether the call was accepted.
contract/recorded-check/answer · Recorded check file · answer — Required and a JSON object; key order is not enforced.
contract/recorded-check/arguments · Recorded check file · arguments — Argument names drawn from that verb's schema.
contract/recorded-check/digest · Recorded check file · digest — 16 lowercase hex characters.
contract/recorded-check/masked · Recorded check file · masked — True on a `type` record alone.
contract/recorded-check/masked-stand-in · A recorded check · MASKED_STAND_IN — The text "masked", with masked:true, stands for a recorded type to a masked or unresolved control.
contract/recorded-check/start-record · Recorded check file · start record — The array opens with `{"tool":"start","arguments":{"app":…}}`.
contract/recorded-check/tool · Recorded check file · tool — One of the ten instance verbs.
contract/snapshot-value/masked-value · The snapshot's value · MASKED_VALUE — Eight U+2022 characters, one fixed marker standing for a password or file input's non-empty value on every carrier.
contract/stable-element-id/carriers · The stable element id · carriers — The stable element id leaves by the platform adapter, the driver's answers, MCP results and kept checks, and is written by escher's code to no log.
contract/stable-element-id/no-node-id · The stable element id · NodeId — No `NodeId` crosses any carrier of the stable element id.
contract/stable-element-id/stability · Stable element id · stability — A stable id is never a list index, pointer, hash, clock or process-local value, so a row reads the same id across a re-render, a remount and a second process.
contract/stable-element-id/unresolved-node · Stable element id · non-element, stale or detached node — A non-element, stale or detached node reads no id, and no path computation panics.
decision/accessible-name-exits · Ratified exits of accessible names — Accessible names leave the process only through the platform accessibility adapter, a hosted call's answer in the snapshot text and diff JSON over the session socket and the client's stdout, and MCP tool results, and reach no log. · why: Each carrier ratified.
decision/attribute-text-leaves-by-ratified-carriers · Attribute text leaves only by ratified carriers — Markup attribute values, names and descriptions leave escher only by the ratified carriers. · except: The page's own form submission and events.
decision/disabled-read-by-presence · disabled read by presence on form controls — The disabled attribute is read by its presence, whatever its value, and only on a button, input, select or textarea, for focusability, pointer and keyboard activation and the snapshot's enabled and clickable readings. · why: The presence reading was ratified.
decision/driver-socket-closed-grammar · Driver socket closed request grammar — The driver session socket takes one request line per connection, parsed against a closed grammar under a size bound, one connection at a time under fixed bounds; anything else is refused with nothing run, and a decoded call runs through the session's one run path alone.
decision/external-navigation-get-http-mailto · External navigation limited to safe schemes — Navigation handed to an external browser is limited to GET requests with http, https or mailto schemes.
decision/external-navigation-schemes · External navigation limited — Navigation handed to an external browser is limited to GET requests with http, https or mailto schemes.
decision/screen-pixels-in-band · Screen pixels in band — A screenshot's PNG travels inside the answer itself as base64 text, on the command line and as an MCP image block. · why: Ratified as the in-band crossing.
decision/screenshot-in-band · Screenshot carried in band — A screenshot's PNG crosses in band, as base64 inside its JSON answer line or as an MCP image block, the whole screen or one element's visible part, a password input painted masked, under the unchanged answer bound. · why: The in-band image was the ratified choice, a boundary widening.
decision/session-label-form · Session label form — A session label is 1 to 32 bytes of a-z, 0-9 and -, checked before the caller's boot runs; it is never document text, and is the one caller string a reply carries.
decision/session-socket-unix-only · Session socket is Unix only — The driver session socket exists on Unix only; elsewhere a session is `Unsupported`.
decision/state-directory-long-path-refused · Too-long state directory path refused — A state directory path too long for a socket address is refused with a fixed message holding no path.
decision/state-directory-non-recursive-delete · Non-recursive session cleanup — Only the socket file and then the state directory are ever deleted, non-recursively.
contract/driver-argument-kinds/flag · Driver argument kinds · flag — True or false.
contract/driver-argument-kinds/key · Driver argument kinds · key — One name of a closed twelve-name list.
contract/driver-argument-kinds/milliseconds · Driver argument kinds · milliseconds — A whole number from 1 to 60000.
contract/driver-argument-kinds/name · Driver argument kinds · name — Text of 1 to 32 bytes of a-z, 0-9 and -.
contract/driver-argument-kinds/part · Driver argument kinds · part — A whole number from 1 to 1000.
contract/driver-call-id/length-bound · Driver call id · length bound — An id a call names, from the command-line `--id` flag, the socket's `call` request or an MCP tool's `id` argument, is bounded at 1 to 1024 bytes, checked in the client before a session is touched and again in the host.
contract/driver-command-span/cause · The driver command span · cause — The name of the returned refusal's cause, unrecorded until it applies.
contract/driver-command-span/verb · The driver command span · verb — The verb table's own word, never the caller's verb text.
contract/screenshot-answer/png · Screenshot answer · png — `{"width":…,"height":…,"png":"<base64>"}`, a PNG of the whole screen or of one element's visible part.
contract/stable-element-id/anchored-path · Stable element id · anchored path — An element with no author key reads `{key}//{segment}` (then `/{segment}` per further DOM level) under the nearest keyed element of its own component instance, else its component path, else its document path; an anchor acts inside one component only.
contract/stable-element-id/author-key · Stable element id · author key — An element's HTML `id` is its author key only when it is non-empty, holds no `/` and is the first element in document pre-order to claim it; an empty, `/`-bearing or later-duplicate value gives no key and anchors nothing.
contract/stable-element-id/derivation · The stable element id · derivation — The HTML `id` is the author key when non-empty, `/`-free and first in document order; otherwise an anchored, component or document path is used, so no `id` can make two ids equal.
contract/stable-element-id/keyed-list-segment · Stable element id · keyed list row segment — A keyed list row's segment carries its Dioxus key as `{tag}[{key}]`; a Dioxus key that is empty or holds `/` is refused and the row reads the positional `{tag}:{n}` segment instead.
contract/stable-element-id/no-collision · Stable element id · uniqueness — An author key holds no `/`, an anchored path is the only id holding `//`, and a component or document path has no empty segment, so no `id` attribute can make two ids equal, a key spelled like a component name included.

## data-protection · ## Data Protection
decision/committed-counter-checks · Committed stand-Counter checks — The only committed kept checks are the two of the repository's scripted stand-Counter sessions, holding no typed text, host path, name or secret and no `screenshot` step, read only through the strict `Check::from_bytes`. · why: The one exception to a kept check's owner-only medium.
decision/kept-check-actions-answer · Kept check holds the actions answer — A kept actions answer holds ids, owner ids, keyed booleans, the table's verb words and closed cause words, never a control value, typed text or NodeId. · why: A boundary widening, ratified. · guard: stand_replay a_kept_actions_step_replays_and_a_changed_one_stops_naming_nodes
decision/kept-check-answer-whole · Kept check keeps each answer whole — A kept check keeps each answer as the line the driver wrote, masked as on every carrier, with a shot kept as its width and height and never its pixels. · why: Ratified, a shot's pixels excepted.
decision/kept-check-call-content · Kept check call-content class — A kept check holds call content: target ids, press keys, advance ms and text typed into unmasked controls, a masked or unresolved type's text kept as MASKED_STAND_IN. · why: Ratified.
decision/kept-check-owner-only · Kept checks are owner-only — A recorded check is written 0600 into a 0700 directory the launcher named, is never logged, and is never removed by escher but for its own check when a recording ends. · why: Ratified. · guard: recording::the_committed_checks_are_what_the_binary_records · except: Two scripted stand-Counter checks, one through the command line and one through the mcp role, are committed publicly, holding no typed text, host path, name or secret and no screenshot step.
decision/kept-checks-owner-only · Kept checks owner-only and uncommitted — A kept check stays in an owner-only medium, is never logged and is never committed. · except: The two committed checks of the repository's own scripted stand-Counter sessions.
contract/kept-check-file/contents · Kept check files · contents — A kept check holds per call its verb, arguments, acceptance, digest and masked answer, never a pixel.
contract/kept-check-file/entry · Kept check file · entry — A check is a JSON array: the app label, then per answered call its verb, its arguments, its acceptance, a FNV-1a 64 digest of its written answer and the answer itself as answer.
contract/kept-check-file/lifecycle · Kept check files · lifecycle — A kept check is never logged and never removed by escher, but for its own check when a recording ends.
contract/kept-check-file/medium · Kept check files · medium — Under `--record <dir>` or `Session::recording_into`, one `check-{n}.json` with mode `0600` per recorded session is written in a `0700` directory the launcher named.

## api-security · ## API Security
decision/actions-answer-unpaged · The actions answer is unpaged — The actions verb takes no argument and a screen's whole answer is one answer under the 1,048,576-byte answer bound. · guard: stand_actions the_whole_cells_answer_is_within_the_answer_bound
decision/external-targets-to-system-browser · External targets open in the system browser — Navigation to external targets goes to the system browser.
decision/form-dialog-method-rejected · Form submission by scheme and method — Form submission goes by scheme and method, and the `dialog` method is rejected.
decision/no-wait-verb-fields · No wait argument or result on verbs — No driver verb has an argument or a result field of a wait.
decision/time-moves-only-on-advance · Time moves only on advance — Time on a held instance moves only when a caller asks for it with advance, 1 to 60000 ms a call; no driver verb has an argument or result field of a wait, and snapshot, screenshot, lint, graph and actions wait on no load.
contract/driver-answer/settled · Driver command answer · settled — A step that ran and did not go quiet is a result, settled false with its busy class, not a refusal; the outcome names a class only, never a URL, request, node, id, name or value.
decision/bounded-load-wait · Bounded wait on loads in flight — A harness settle never waits on a load in flight, and the driver's acting step waits on one for at most `LOAD_WAIT`. · why: So the absent request timeout cannot hang a settle or a command.
decision/iframe-navigation-to-parent · Iframe navigations routed to the parent — Iframe navigations route back to the parent document.
decision/load-wait-bound · Acting commands bounded by LOAD_WAIT — An acting driver command waits on a load in flight for at most LOAD_WAIT, 5 s of wall time, moving no time on the held instance, then returns the load still in flight as settled false with its busy class. · why: The absent request timeout cannot hang a command.
contract/session-socket/oversize · Driver session socket · oversize — An answer is at most 1,048,576 bytes on its JSON line; over it the reply is oversize, read by the client as AnswerTooLarge.
contract/session-wire/recording-failed · Driver session wire · ok v3 recording-failed — Wire v3 replies include the fixed reply ok v3 recording-failed.

decision/serde-json-read-only · serde_json, read only — serde_json, with no features and no preserve_order, reads the MCP server's untrusted stdin, a kept check's bytes and the driver's own answer line for replay, and writes nothing. · why: Chosen as read-only use.
decision/serde-json-untrusted-input-reader · serde_json as the untrusted input reader — serde_json, a workspace dependency with no preserve_order feature, is the reader of the MCP server's untrusted stdin, of a kept check's bytes and of the driver's answer line the replay compares.

## secret-management · ## Secret Management
decision/driver-reads-only-rust-log · Driver reads only RUST_LOG — The escher-driver library and the escher-session binary read no environment variable beyond RUST_LOG.

## error-handling · ## Error Handling
decision/closed-refusal-cause-set · Closed refusal cause set — A driver command refusal is a typed value whose cause comes from a closed set of eight, with a fault only beside `malformed`; a new verb or argument shape is refused within the set, never by adding a cause. · why: The closed set of eight was ratified.
decision/refusal-closed-cause-set · Command refusal as a closed set of causes — An escher-driver command refusal is a typed value from a closed set of eight causes, each with a fixed name, meaning and remedy holding no path, and with no free-text field. · why: So a refusal cannot hold anything a call supplied. · except: A Fault is carried only beside the malformed cause.
decision/refusal-holds-no-call-input · A refusal holds nothing a call supplied — Every refusal's name, meaning and remedy is a fixed static text holding no path, and a fault carries at most the schema's own argument name, so a refusal cannot hold anything a call supplied.
decision/refusal-log-cause-name-only · Only a refusal's cause name is logged — Exactly one thing of a refusal reaches a log: its cause's fixed name, as the `cause` field of the call's driver span; no fault, meaning, remedy or display text is logged.
decision/refusal-logged-by-cause-name · Refusal logged by cause name only — Of an escher-driver command refusal, only its cause's fixed name reaches a log.
decision/stale-node-ids-never-panic · Stale node ids never panic — A stale node id is skipped in layout children and resolves to none on lookup rather than panicking; a stale animation entry for a removed node is skipped on the next resolve. · guard: stale_interaction_state, stale_node_mapping, animations and custom_widget_layout tests
contract/query-apis/missing-element · Query APIs · missing element — Query APIs return Result<Option<NodeId>>, and a missing element is None.
contract/refusal-causes/covered · Driver refusal causes · covered — The target is covered at its hit point; its fixed meaning states the hit's limits, among them that an option of a closed select reads covered, remedied by clicking the select first.
contract/refusal-causes/malformed · Driver refusal causes · malformed — The one cause that carries a fault; a call breaking the schema, such as a `graph` or `actions` call with an argument, is refused with it and nothing runs.
contract/refusal-causes/not-found · Driver refusal causes · not-found — One of the eight closed causes, with a fixed name, meaning and remedy holding no path.
contract/refusal-causes/stale · Driver refusal causes · stale — One of the eight closed causes, with a fixed name, meaning and remedy holding no path.
decision/coverage-refuses-bad-checks-malformed · Coverage refuses an unusable check as malformed — The `coverage` role refuses a check file it cannot read, one past the check bound, one that is no check or a check of another app as `malformed`, holding nothing of the path or the file, and adds no cause.
decision/session-error-fixed-table · Session errors from a fixed table — An escher-driver session error is written from a fixed table, holding nothing a call supplied.
contract/cli-exit-codes/1 · escher-session CLI exit codes · 1 — The call was refused; the refusal JSON is written to stdout.
contract/cli-exit-codes/2 · escher-session CLI exit codes · 2 — Usage: the argv shape is not one the command takes; one fixed usage line on stderr, stdout empty, nothing booted and no state created.
contract/cli-exit-codes/3 · CLI exit codes · 3 — Session error: the error object with kind, message and remedy on stdout and its fixed message on stderr; a boot that fails ends with its session error.
contract/refusal-causes/disabled · Driver refusal causes · disabled — One of the eight closed causes, with a fixed name, meaning and remedy holding no path.
contract/refusal-causes/fonts-unavailable · Driver refusal causes · fonts-unavailable — One of the eight closed causes, returned by the executor, with a fixed name, meaning and remedy holding no path.
contract/refusal-causes/off-screen · Driver refusal causes · off-screen — The element lies outside the visible part, including outside a scrolling box that holds it; its remedy names the `scroll` verb.
contract/refusal-causes/unknown-verb · Driver refusal causes · unknown-verb — One of the eight closed causes, with a fixed name, meaning and remedy holding no path.
contract/refusal-json/cause · Refusal JSON · cause — The refusal's cause name, inside `{"refused":{...}}`, built from the cause's fixed strings.
contract/session-error-json/kind · Session error JSON · kind — One fixed kebab-case word per session error variant, inside `{"error":{...}}`.
contract/session-error-json/message · Session error JSON · message — The error's fixed meaning, holding no path.
contract/session-error-json/remedy · Session error JSON · remedy — The error's fixed remedy text.

## logging-monitoring · ## Logging & Monitoring
decision/no-screen-content-in-logs · Screen content stays out of logs — No driver call puts screen content in a log: typed text, element ids, accessible names, a shot's image, lint findings, a part's text, a UI graph, an actions answer and a coverage check reach no log line at any level. · guard: stand_act_spans, host_log and mcp_log, read at RUST_LOG=trace under both builds
decision/session-output-holds-no-caller-input · Session output holds no caller input — No escher-session output line holds anything the caller typed. · except: The mcp role's echoed request id.
contract/command-span/cause · The command span line · cause — Recorded when the call is refused, as a closed cause word such as fonts-unavailable.
contract/command-span/verb · The command span line · verb — Records the instance-level verb; a graph or actions call records the verb alone, plus cause when refused.
contract/escher-session-output/caller-text · escher-session output · caller-typed text — No output line echoes a caller's argument but the admitted request id the mcp role echoes; an answer carries each node's current value, so text typed into an unmasked control returns, a masked input reading only the mask.
decision/cold-agent-recordings-owner-only · Cold-agent recordings owner-only — The cold-agent live server records its kept checks into an owner-only directory, read for booleans and counts only, never printed, copied or committed, and removed at cleanup; the replay children run without recording.
decision/escher-telemetry-allowlist-sink · escher's allowlist telemetry sink — Both seven_guis binaries log through escher's own stderr-only allowlist subscriber. · except: The scrubbing reaches that sink only: upstream's fmt::init subscribers, env_logger and the panic hook stay unscrubbed.
decision/stderr-only-telemetry-sink · Escher's own stderr telemetry sink — Both seven_guis binaries, the native app and the escher-session driver host, install escher's own telemetry sink first thing: a stderr-only subscriber whose formatter applies an allowlist of targets. · except: The upstream apps' stdout subscribers and the WPT runner's env_logger stay unscrubbed, and the chained std panic hook still prints the raw panic message to stderr.
contract/command-span/line · The command span line · line — A sink-installing host writes one closed command span line per call it runs.
contract/escher-session-output/accepted-stderr · escher-session output · stderr of an accepted command — An accepted command's stderr is empty with RUST_LOG unset.
contract/escher-session-output/esc-byte · escher-session output · ESC byte — No output line holds an ESC byte; output is uncoloured whatever the stream is.
contract/escher-session-stderr/error-messages · escher-session stderr · error messages — escher-session writes error messages on stderr.
contract/escher-session-stderr/usage-messages · escher-session stderr · usage messages — escher-session writes usage messages on stderr.
contract/escher-session-stdout/command-line · escher-session stdout · command result line — escher-session writes one uncoloured JSON line per command on stdout.

The remaining controls govern outbound requests and in-document navigation.
