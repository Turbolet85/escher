# a11y-plan · the rows that bind 2026-11-14-bundled-fonts — picked 48 of 240 (37 by every draw) · rule any · pin 800

## a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin 1-a11y-scope-summary
decision/single-select-engine-overlay-list · Single select opens an engine overlay list — A closed single select opens an engine overlay list on every document, remote pages included, answered first by hit testing and painted after the root. · why: driver click on a select opens it; pinned by a_click_opens_the_list_and_a_click_on_a_row_chooses_it and a_button_under_the_list_is_refused_covered
decision/driver-requires-accessibility · Session library always enables accessibility — The escher-driver session library enables accessibility on dioxus-native-dom unconditionally, with no feature table of its own, so the feature reaches every binary that depends on it. · why: Its executor reads the snapshot, which stands behind that feature.

## 2-a11y-strategy · ## 2. A11y Strategy · twin a11y-strategy
decision/role-attribute-then-element-then-unknown · Role from role attribute, element, else Unknown — A node's role is taken from its role attribute, else from the HTML element mapping, else Unknown. · why: snapshot role readings and the stand checks controls_carry_role_and_name and aria_checked_reads_its_three_values_on_a_checkable_role_alone read roles set this way

## a11y-strategy · ## 2. A11y Strategy · twin 2-a11y-strategy
decision/a11y-tree-refresh-on-change · Accessibility tree refreshed on change — The accessibility tree is built from the document when first requested and rebuilt on a poll whose drained changed set was non-empty. · why: Ratified, one item with the engine's changed-set contract. · guard: stand_accessibility_ids
decision/changed-set-marks · What the engine's changed set marks — The engine's changed set marks a mutation of an in-document node, a focus or checked change, a text control's input, a select's changed choice and a single select's list opening or closing, a scroll that closes a list included; node creation, hover, active, any other scroll and layout do not. · why: Ratified, one item with the accessibility tree's refresh on change.
decision/agent-readers-behind-accessibility · Snapshot readers behind the accessibility feature — The snapshot, its text and diff, the unkeyed-actionable check, the UI graph reader and the actionable-node reader stand behind dioxus-native-dom's accessibility feature; the signal registry and the reached-handler record are not gated.

## 3-a11y-assertion-harness-contract · ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/wcag-contrast-thresholds · WCAG 2.x text contrast thresholds — Text contrast is measured by the WCAG 2.x formula from computed styles and must reach 4.5, or 3.0 for large text. · guard: stand_contrast

## 4-aria-patterns-roles · ## 4. ARIA Patterns & Roles · twin aria-patterns-roles
contract/accessibility-tree-hidden-content/display-none · Accessibility tree hidden content · display: none — display: none excludes the node and its children from the tree, except an option under a select.

## aria-patterns-roles · ## 4. ARIA Patterns & Roles · twin 4-aria-patterns-roles
decision/hidden-content-excluded · Hidden content kept out of the tree — An aria-hidden true node is kept but marked hidden, while hidden, inert, display none and visibility hidden exclude the node and its children from the accessibility tree. · why: Every option of a single select but its chosen one computes display none. · guard: accessibility_hidden · except: A select's option is excepted from display none and stays in the tree; hidden, inert and visibility hidden still exclude it.

## keyboard-navigation · ## 5. Keyboard Navigation · twin 5-keyboard-navigation
decision/driver-type-focuses-select-no-click · Driver type focuses a select with no click — The driver's type on a select focuses it with no click and adds nothing to the driver's closed sets of verbs, arguments, key names, result fields, causes, session errors or exits. · why: pinned by type_leaves_no_list_open_and_chooses_by_its_text in the stand_act_popup driver tests

## 6-visual-design-verification · ## 6. Visual Design Verification · twin visual-design-verification
decision/lint-contrast-single-formula · Lint contrast through one formula — The driver's visual lint reads contrast through the harness's text contrast with the stand's exempt rule, never a second formula or threshold.
decision/stand-contrast-measured · Stand contrast measured from computed styles — SC 1.4.3 is measured on the stand from computed styles with the WCAG 2.x ratio, 3.0 required of large text and else 4.5, a row exempt exactly where the snapshot's enabled reads Some(false). · guard: stand_contrast, the_load_page_meets_its_ratios, cells_meets_its_ratios
contract/visual-lint-finding/content · visual lint finding · content — A visual lint finding is written as ids, closed words and numbers only.
contract/accessibility-tree/hidden-and-inert-nodes · accessibility tree · hidden and inert nodes — Nodes with display: none or visibility: hidden or carrying inert, and their descendants, are excluded from the accessibility tree and the snapshot, a select's option excepted from display: none.

## visual-design-verification · ## 6. Visual Design Verification · twin 6-visual-design-verification
decision/contrast-exempt-disabled-controls · Disabled controls exempt from contrast — A contrast row is exempt exactly where the snapshot's enabled reads Some(false); a label[for=…] row is never exempt.
decision/hidpi-or-zoom-change-reshapes-text · Hidpi or zoom change reshapes text — A total scale change from hidpi or zoom invalidates text shaping. · why: the shell's scale-factor change and the browser zoom keys write hidpi scale and zoom, and rely on text being reshaped at the new scale
decision/lint-contrast-shares-one-reader · Lint contrast shares the harness reader — The visual lint's contrast reading uses the harness's one contrast reader, its required ratio and the stand check's exempt rule, so a blended text's pair is unread by the lint as well. · why: no second formula or threshold
decision/select-list-rows-one-height · Open select list rows take one height — An open select list's rows take one height, the select's font on one line, so a row with a larger authored font clips, a stated limit.
decision/stand-accent-colour · Stand accent colour — The stand's accent is rest #3a5ce5, hover #2a4cd3, active #1f3fc1, stand-wide in every task CSS that declares it, a stand change and no engine change. · why: white on the earlier accent #4a6cf7 read 4.39 against 4.5, failing
decision/stand-contrast-asserted · SC 1.4.3 asserted on the stand — SC 1.4.3 is asserted on every measured non-exempt stand row, in both layout modes, on the four lean tasks, the load page and Cells, and the check runs in the workspace test leg, per package and in the a11y leg. · guard: stand_contrast
decision/stand-lint-clean-at-boot · Stand reads no lint finding at boot — The stand at boot reads no visual lint finding of any kind on the four lean tasks, in both layout modes. · guard: the_stand_at_boot_reads_its_measured_findings
decision/text-contrast-required-ratio · Text contrast required ratio per SC 1.4.3 — Text contrast is the WCAG 2.x ratio of the text colour against the background composited source-over down to the first opaque layer, and 3.0 is required of large text (at least 24 px, or 14 pt at weight 700 or more) and 4.5 of other text.
decision/viewport-scheme-and-zoom-level · Viewport carries scheme and zoom, 1.0 unzoomed — The viewport carries a light/dark color scheme and a document zoom level, 1.0 unzoomed. · why: the stylo device reads the scheme for prefers-color-scheme and the scale from zoom; the shell and harness configs set both
contract/lint-contrast-finding/bounds · the lint's contrast finding · bounds — A contrast finding carries the node's bounds as numbers.
contract/lint-contrast-finding/defect · the lint's contrast finding · defect — A contrast finding carries its defect as a closed word.
contract/lint-contrast-finding/id · the lint's contrast finding · id — A contrast finding carries the id of the node read below its required ratio.
contract/lint-contrast-finding/ratio · the lint's contrast finding · ratio — A contrast finding carries the measured contrast ratio as a number.
contract/lint-contrast-finding/required · the lint's contrast finding · required — A contrast finding carries the required contrast ratio as a number.
decision/contrast-unread-past-non-colour-paint · Contrast unread past non-colour paint — The text contrast reading reads nothing where an element on its walk has opacity below 1, a non-empty filter, a background-image layer or a mix-blend-mode other than normal. · guard: a_blended_ancestor_reads_none_and_an_unblended_one_its_pair
decision/hidden-content-excluded-from-a11y-tree · Hidden content excluded from the accessibility tree — Nodes with `display: none`, `visibility: hidden` or carrying `inert`, and their descendants, are excluded from the accessibility tree and so from the snapshot. · except: A select's options are excepted from `display: none`, so they stand under the select in the tree and the snapshot, directly or through an `optgroup`.
decision/highlighted-row-contrast-unread · Highlighted list row contrast unread by the lint — The visual lint's contrast reads an open list row's plain pair even when the row is highlighted, so a highlighted row's contrast is unread by the lint, a stated limit.
decision/multiple-select-chosen-row-pair · Multiple select chosen-row colour pair — A multiple select's chosen rows read #000000 on #c8c8c8, Chromium's inactive selected pair, hardcoded in the default sheet. · why: hardcoded by design, as the engine holds no tokens · guard: select_interaction
contract/driver-click-refusals/covered · Driver click refusals · covered — A driver click on an element under an open select list is refused `covered`.

## 7-screen-reader-support · ## 7. Screen Reader Support · twin screen-reader-support
decision/snapshot-model-single-source · Snapshot model as single source — The snapshot's text form, parts, diff, MCP results, node-key help and screenshot read the snapshot model and nothing else.
contract/select-open-list/optgroup-header · single-choice select, list open · optgroup header — An optgroup is painted as a header of an open list, heavier than a row by weight on every build, and a header chooses nothing.
contract/snapshot/multiple-select-rows-and-value · snapshot · multiple select rows and value — A multiple select's rows read their own client rects in the snapshot, and its value reads its first chosen option in tree order.
contract/snapshot/select-list-rows · snapshot · select list rows — The snapshot holds no expanded key and the highlighted row is in no snapshot and no tree; an open list's row reads its own bounds in the list.
decision/adapter-tree-equals-harness-tree · Adapter tree equals harness tree — On the stand the tree the shell hands the adapter equals the harness's tree node for node, and every interactive-role node of the four lean tasks reads a non-empty name.

## screen-reader-support · ## 7. Screen Reader Support · twin 7-screen-reader-support
decision/option-labels-leave-only-as-pixels · Option labels leave an open list only as pixels — An option's label and a group's label leave an open list only as painted pixels in a screenshot and the snapshot's name, with no log site. · why: ratified
decision/readers-of-one-snapshot-model · One snapshot model, many readers — The text form, the diff, the text parts, MCP tool results, the node keys' help and the screenshot read only the one snapshot model, with no second role or name mapping.
decision/screenshot-changes-nothing · A screenshot changes nothing — Taking a screenshot moves no focus, leaves has_changes false and leaves the next diff empty.
decision/text-runs-label-their-parent · Text runs label their parent element — Text nodes become TextRun nodes carrying their text, and their parent is labelled by them, so an element's text reaches its accessible name. · why: accessible names of buttons and controls come from it; pinned by every_interactive_role_element_reads_a_name and role_and_name_match_the_accessibility_tree
contract/driver-screenshot/element-shot · the driver's screenshot · an element shot — An element shot, addressed by stable id and refused as every id-addressed call is, is the node's bounds rounded outward and cropped to the part that can be seen.
contract/driver-screenshot/row-shot · the driver's screenshot · a shot of an open list's row — A shot of a row crops to it and leaves the list open.
contract/snapshot-text/parts · the snapshot text form · parts — A screen over the text budget is read in parts of consecutive pre-order lines, never a split line, concatenating to the whole text with every node id on exactly one line.
contract/snapshot/closed-select-option-bounds · the snapshot · a closed select's options — A closed select's options read under it, each with the select's client rect as its bounds.
contract/snapshot/multiple-select-row-bounds · the snapshot · a multiple select's rows and groups — A multiple select's rows and groups read their own client rects as their bounds, unlike a closed select's options.
contract/snapshot/open-list-row-bounds · the snapshot · an open list's rows — A select whose list is open is no closed select; an open row's bounds is its painted row's in the snapshot and the diff, the diff's differs naming bounds.

## 3-a11y-assertion-harness-contract · ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
> NOT YET MEASURED — the structured violation JSON schema / log format, the WCAG criteria mapping of the existing tests and a screen-reader test pattern: no slice recorded them (s01, s02, s06, s07 and s13 recorded the a11y assertion harness as out of slice). The obs log format is now measured for escher's own sink (obs plan §3, §6 Log Coverage, §8): non-JSON text lines on stderr in two record classes — one line per printed event, `{RFC 3339 UTC time} {LEVEL} {target} service.name=… service.version=… {field}={value}…`, and, since 2026-10-07-driver-command-spans, one line per closed span of an admitted target, the same prefix then `span={the span's name}`, the span's recorded fields and the layer's close fields `message`, `time.busy` and `time.idle`, with no line when a span is created, recorded to, entered or exited (the second class was ratified by the founder, 2026-10-09, as obs plan §6 states) — both behind a target allowlist that, among others, prints only `node_id` / `status` / `waiting_nodes` / `property` / `log.*` fields for `blitz*` and `accesskit_xplat` targets, redacts `text`, `value`, `html` and `attrs` for escher's own targets (`escher_*`) and drops a record from any other target whole, at every level — a closed span's every pair judged by the same rule, an outside target's span writing nothing; an a11y violation schema is not yet defined against it.
