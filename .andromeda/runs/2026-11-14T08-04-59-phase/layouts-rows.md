# layout-templates · the rows that bind 2026-11-14-bundled-fonts — picked 17 of 120 (14 by every draw) · rule any · pin 800

## surface-desktop-native · ## Surface: desktop-native
decision/flight-type-select-boot-reading · Flight type select reads its two options at boot — The snapshot reads the flight booker's mode select at boot as ComboBox "Flight type" with value one-way and two ListBoxOptions, each at the select's client rect. · why: the_flight_type_select_holds_its_two_options in stand_snapshot pins role, name, value, both ListBoxOptions and their select-rect bounds in both layout modes
decision/headless-stand-pinned-viewport · Headless stand pinned viewport — The headless stand skips Home and mounts one task in TaskShell at a pinned 800 × 600, scale 1.0, Light viewport with the bundled DejaVu Sans.
decision/session-roles-share-stand-boot · Session roles share the stand boot — Every escher-session role that boots a task (host, mcp, coverage) boots it through the same stand boot the command line uses, adding no markup, id, class, style, wrapper or order.
decision/stand-lints-clean-at-boot · Stand lints clean at boot — At boot the counter, the flight booker, the timer, CRUD and the load page read zero visual-lint findings, in both layout modes. · guard: stand_lint
decision/open-list-rows-own-bounds · Open list rows read their own bounds — While a select list is open each row reads its own bounds in the snapshot and the diff, and after a close the rows read back at the select's client rect. · why: stand_act_popup checks a click opening the list names each row's bounds in the diff, and escape closing it puts the rows back at the select's box
