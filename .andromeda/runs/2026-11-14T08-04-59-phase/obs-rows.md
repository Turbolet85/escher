## 3-observability-harness-contract · ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/driver-library-installs-no-subscriber · Driver library installs no subscriber — The driver library, its command line, MCP server and coverage reader included, installs no subscriber and reads no environment variable; only a binary's own main installs the sink.
decision/headless-stand-no-sink · Headless stand runs with no sink — A headless boot made in process installs no telemetry subscriber and reads no environment variable; a headless boot made by the escher-session binary runs under that binary's sink. · except: The MCP tools check installs its own in-process recording subscriber, and the command-span check's two re-run children install escher's sink over an in-memory capture.
contract/command-answer/linted · driver command answer · findings — A lint answer is written as one JSON object with a findings array, kept whole in a recorded check and never logged or fielded.
contract/command-answer/shot · driver command answer · shot — A screenshot answer holds width, height and the PNG; over MCP it is an image block followed by the JSON line without the PNG, and is never logged or fielded.
contract/escher-session-stdout/command-answer · escher-session stdout · command answer — Each command's answer, refusal or session-error object is one uncoloured line of JSON on stdout, an answer and never a log line; the host role ends quiet.
contract/kept-check/accepted · kept check file · accepted — Each answered call records whether it was accepted.
contract/kept-check/answer · kept check file · answer — Each answered call records the answer itself, a screenshot's without the PNG.
contract/kept-check/answer-digest · kept check file · answer digest — Each answered call records its answer's FNV-1a 64 digest.
contract/kept-check/arguments · kept check file · arguments — Each answered call's arguments are written into the kept check, a file at rest, never a log line, field or print.
decision/checks-silent · Silent checks and shared modules — Checks, their shared modules and the stand-ins they use install no subscriber, read no environment variable and print nothing, their readings going into assertions only, and the code they pin adds no log site, span, field or env read. · except: Checks whose subject is telemetry install escher's sink, the MCP tools check its own recorder, the paint-tree bench reads one opt-in env var, and a re-run child prints ids or digests its parent reads.
decision/one-span-per-command · One span per driver command — Each driver command opens exactly one command span, which writes only where a process has installed a sink at info or below.
decision/replay-children-uninstrumented · Replay children uninstrumented — A judged check is replayed on further escher-session mcp children spawned directly, without --record, with stderr to /dev/null. · why: uninstrumented by design

## 4-span-trace-coverage · ## 4. Span / Trace Coverage · twin span-trace-coverage
decision/driver-emits-no-event · Driver emits no event and installs no subscriber — escher-driver emits no log event and installs no subscriber; its telemetry is its spans alone.
decision/driver-spans-carry-no-content · Driver spans carry no content — escher-driver's spans field only closed words, bools and counts, never the screen text, any argument, a shot byte, a lint finding, a part number, or any Command, Call, ArgValue, Outcome, Refusal or Fault.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/added · escher-driver command span · added — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.

contract/escher-driver-command-span/cause · escher-driver command span · cause — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/changed · escher-driver command span · changed — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/passes · escher-driver command span · passes — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/removed · escher-driver command span · removed — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/settled · escher-driver command span · settled — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/span · escher-driver command span · command — Every call handed to Session::run opens one INFO span named command at target escher_driver.
contract/escher-driver-command-span/verb · escher-driver command span · verb — A field of the command span, a closed word, bool or count, recorded only where it applies.
contract/escher-driver-tool-call-span/ending · escher-driver tool_call span · ending — A closed word, one of accepted, refused or error.
contract/escher-driver-tool-call-span/span · escher-driver tool_call span · tool_call — One tool_call span is opened per MCP tools/call request, before its params are read, and held until its reply is written; it has two fields and no other.
contract/escher-driver-tool-call-span/tool · escher-driver tool_call span · tool — The verb table's word for the called tool, a closed word.

## span-trace-coverage · ## 4. Span / Trace Coverage · twin 4-span-trace-coverage
contract/refusal-cause/fonts-unavailable · Refusal cause names · fonts-unavailable — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by the executor before anything is painted when the held app has no font it can paint text with.
decision/command-span-no-call-content · No call content in the command span — The command span never fields an argument, an id, the screen text, an accessible name, an image or its size, lint findings, graph content, the session label, or any command, call, outcome or refusal value. · why: An argument fielded by its schema name, or a command or outcome fielded with Debug, would print an id, typed text, an accessible name or a control's value. · guard: stand_act_spans
decision/tool-call-span-two-closed-fields · tool_call span with tool and ending — Each MCP tools/call request writes one tool_call span carrying exactly two fields, tool and ending, each a closed word. · why: Ratified as the span's shape. · guard: stand_mcp_tools

contract/command-span/busy · The driver's command span · busy — One of three busy-class words, the schema's word for the busy class, recorded from an acting verb's outcome when the outcome carries one.
contract/command-span/cause · The driver's command span · cause — Recorded at one site for every refusal the run returns: one of eight fixed cause names, class words holding nothing a call supplied.
contract/command-span/changed · The driver's command span · changed — The length of the returned diff's changed list, recorded from an acting verb's outcome.
contract/command-span/passes · The driver's command span · passes — Settle's pass count, recorded from an acting verb's outcome when settle answered quiet; on a step that waited on a load, the settle that went quiet.
contract/command-span/removed · The driver's command span · removed — The length of the returned diff's removed list, recorded from an acting verb's outcome.
contract/command-span/settled · The driver's command span · settled — Recorded from an acting verb's outcome only; snapshot, screenshot, lint, graph, actions and a part read record verb alone, and a refusal records verb and cause alone.
contract/command-span/span · The driver's command span · span — One span per call handed to the session's run, target escher_driver, name command, level INFO, entered before validation and held until the run returns, so a refusal is inside it.
contract/refusal-cause/covered · Refusal cause names · covered — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by the executor.
contract/refusal-cause/disabled · Refusal cause names · disabled — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by the executor.
contract/refusal-cause/malformed · Refusal cause names · malformed — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by validation.
contract/refusal-cause/not-found · Refusal cause names · not-found — A closed refusal class word recorded in the command span's cause field, returned by the executor.

contract/tool-call-span/ending · The MCP tool_call span · ending — One of three closed words saying how the call ended: `accepted` · `refused` · `error` (a session error or a protocol error).
contract/tool-call-span/span · The MCP tool_call span · span — One span, target escher_driver, name tool_call, level INFO, opened once per MCP tools/call request before its params are read and held until its reply is written.
contract/tool-call-span/tool · The MCP tool_call span · tool — The verb table's word for the tool, one of its fourteen; unrecorded for an unknown tool.

## log-coverage · ## 6. Log Coverage · twin 6-log-coverage
contract/command-span/field-count · The driver's command span · field count — The `command` span keeps its eight fields; the driver's fixed help and meaning texts add no log site or span field.
contract/command-span/line · The driver's command span · line — One closed-span line per command run, INFO at target `escher_driver`, `span="command"`, with the recorded ones of `verb`, `cause`, `settled`, `busy`, `passes`, `added`, `removed`, `changed`; no line at the default `warn`.
contract/command-span/verb · The driver's command span · verb — The verb table's own word for a known verb, run or refused, one of its fourteen words; never the caller's verb text; unrecorded for a verb the table lacks; the three session-level words and the tool-level help appear only beside the cause unknown-verb.
contract/graph-answer/shape · The graph answer · shape — `{"nodes":[…],"states":[…]}`.
contract/host-wire/v3 · The escher-session host wire · v3 — Wire version `v3` carries `hello`, `stop` and `call`.
contract/tool-call-span/line · The driver's tool_call span · line — One closed-span line per MCP tool call, INFO at target `escher_driver`, `span="tool_call"`, with the recorded ones of `tool` and `ending`, then `message="close"`, `time.busy`, `time.idle`; no line at the default `warn`.

## 8-pii-scrubbing-compliance · ## 8. PII Scrubbing & Compliance · twin pii-scrubbing-compliance
decision/scrub-sink-reach · Reach of the scrubbing sink — The scrubbing sink is installed by the two binaries of the seven_guis package; engine events reach it only when an engine tracing feature is on. · except: The upstream apps' stdout subscribers and the WPT runner's env_logger stay unscrubbed.

## pii-scrubbing-compliance · ## 8. PII Scrubbing & Compliance · twin 8-pii-scrubbing-compliance
contract/snapshot-text/clickable · the snapshot text · clickable — The token clickable stands after focused.
decision/driver-span-fields-print · Driver span fields tool and ending print — The tool_call span's fields tool and ending are not in the content-named set and print. · why: both are closed words; the closed-span line was ratified
contract/snapshot-diff/open-list-row-bounds · the snapshot and the diff · open list row bounds — An open list's row crosses by its own bounds, differs naming bounds within its closed set, adding no field, key name, node key or carrier.

contract/snapshot/multiple-select-value · the snapshot · value of a multiple select — The first chosen option in tree order.

## 9-ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin ci-integration
decision/committed-kept-checks-clean · Committed kept checks hold no secrets — The kept checks committed in git hold no typed text, host path or secret.

## ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin 9-ci-integration
decision/committed-checks-hold-no-private-data · Committed checks hold no private data — A kept check committed to git is one of the repository's own scripted stand-Counter sessions and holds no typed text, host path, name, secret or screenshot step. · why: The repository is public.
contract/recording-file/answer · The recording file · answer — Each call's answer is kept whole as the line the driver wrote, masked as on every carrier, with its accepted flag and digest; a shot's answer is held as width and height without png.

## telemetry-strategy · ## 2. Telemetry Strategy · twin 2-telemetry-strategy
overview/telemetry-strategy — Telemetry is the tracing crate's event macros and, in escher-driver, two hand-built spans, command and tool_call. In the engine and upstream crates tracing is compiled in only with the tracing cargo feature. escher-telemetry takes tracing with no feature and always compiles its startup and panic events into the two native binaries, seven_guis_native and escher-session. escher-driver takes tracing ungated, so its spans are written in escher-session through its host, mcp and coverage roles, and by no code path in the windowed seven_guis_native.
