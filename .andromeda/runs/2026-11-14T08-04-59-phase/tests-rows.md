## 1-test-scope-summary · ## 1. Test Scope Summary · twin test-scope-summary
decision/native-platform-ci-matrix · Native platform CI matrix — CI tests on windows and macos and only builds on ios and android; linux is tested by the fast test leg, not the matrix.
decision/dedicated-headless-test-harness · Dedicated headless test harness — Blitz documents are tested headlessly through a dedicated, unpublished harness crate.
decision/driver-executor-integration-tested · Driver executor tested by integration checks — The driver's executor verbs, its refusals and the session lint are tested by integration checks, not unit tests. · why: the driver crate depends on nothing that names a virtual DOM, so a unit test cannot build a held instance
decision/one-test-target-per-behaviour · One integration test target per behaviour — The integration test crate keeps one test-target file per behaviour, beside shared modules that are no target. · why: differs from upstream, whose layout is one all target · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest

## test-scope-summary · ## 1. Test Scope Summary · twin 1-test-scope-summary
decision/blitz-tests-one-target-per-file · One blitz-tests target per file — The blitz-tests manifest holds one test target per file, with upstream's all target left unbuilt. · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest
decision/eight-refusal-causes-in-order · Eight refusal causes in a fixed order — The driver's refusal causes are eight, named in a fixed order with `fonts-unavailable` last, each stating its meaning and a distinct remedy, and a refusal reads as its cause's name, then its remedy. · why: Ratified. · guard: the_eight_causes_are_named_in_order
decision/no-screenshot-step-in-committed-checks · No screenshot step in a committed check — A committed recorded check holds no screenshot step; screenshot repeatability is asserted on one host only. · why: a shot's PNG bytes differ between linux x86_64 and macOS aarch64, so a shot is byte-identical on one host only · guard: stand_screenshot_repeat
decision/snapshot-text-budget · Snapshot text within a byte budget — A screen's snapshot text is read whole when inside SNAPSHOT_TEXT_BUDGET (10,000 bytes); a larger screen is read in parts, each within the budget, the parts concatenating to the whole text. · guard: stand_snapshot_text, stand_snapshot_parts
decision/stand-checks-in-both-layout-modes · Stand checks run in both layout modes — A stand check that reads a screen asserts its readings in both layout modes, and the two modes' readings are held equal where the check compares them.

decision/driver-instance-verbs-tested-by-stand · Driver verbs over a held instance tested by integration — The driver's executor verbs and its readings over a held instance are covered by integration checks, not unit tests, and its JSON writer's node rows are unit-tested over plain parts. · why: The driver crate depends on nothing that names a virtual DOM, so a unit test cannot build a held instance.
decision/mcp-causes-served-with-remedy · Refusal causes served with their remedy over MCP — Every refusal cause a tool call reaches is served through MCP with its remedy. · why: ratified · guard: stand_mcp_tools · except: unknown-verb is not served through MCP
contract/session-recording/same-check-on-both-surfaces · session recording · same check on both surfaces — The command line and the mcp role keep the same check byte for byte, the state directory gone after stop.

decision/font-tests-skip-without-font · Pre-existing font tests skip without a font — The pre-existing font-dependent tests skip at runtime when no usable font is available.
decision/recorded-checks-kept-fresh · Recorded checks kept fresh — A committed recorded check is kept fresh by a byte-for-byte comparison with what the binary records. · guard: seven_guis recording
decision/recorded-checks-replayed-as-tests · Recorded checks replayed as tests — A check a session recorded is committed as data and run as an ordinary cargo test target, every step re-validated through the session and red at the first step whose acceptance or kept answer differs.
decision/shot-png-deterministic-per-host · Shot PNG deterministic on one host — A shot's PNG equals the harness's raster and is byte-identical across runs on one host.
decision/stand-checks-bundled-font-no-skip · Stand checks on the bundled font, no skip — The headless-stand checks have no skip path and assert unconditionally under the bundled DejaVu Sans with system fonts off.
contract/driver-refusals/fonts-unavailable · Driver refusals · fonts-unavailable — A shot of a document whose font context resolves no sans-serif family is refused with nothing painted and no skip path, and the actions read names the same fonts-unavailable for screenshot.

## test-strategy · ## 2. Test Strategy · twin 2-test-strategy
decision/frames-compared-whole · Frames compared whole — A shot's PNG is compared whole, equal to the harness's raster and byte-identical across runs on one host. · guard: stand_act_screenshot, stand_screenshot_repeat
decision/harness-driven-tests · Harness-driven engine tests — Engine tests drive any document through the test harness, which supplies deterministic construction defaults, a pump and tick loop, a settle loop repeated until no work is due, inspection helpers and input synthesis.
decision/no-shot-in-cross-os-byte-checks · No shot in cross-OS byte comparisons — A check compared byte for byte across OSes holds no shot. · why: A shot's PNG bytes differ between linux x86_64 and macOS aarch64.
decision/shot-refused-without-fonts · Shot refused without a usable font — A shot of a document whose font context resolves no sans-serif family is refused with nothing painted and no skip path. · guard: stand_act_screenshot, stand_mcp_tools, font_reading_tests

decision/stand-checks-bundled-font · Stand checks under a bundled font — The headless-stand checks have no skip path and assert unconditionally under the bundled DejaVu Sans, with system fonts off. · except: The pre-existing font-dependent tests skip at runtime when no usable font is available.
contract/record-checks-script/arguments · The committed checks' recording script · arguments — Takes two arguments, the binary and an existing output directory.
decision/capability-claims-name-their-checks · Capability claims name their checks — The capabilities document ends naming the check behind each claim it makes, and states each limit as pinned by its check or as asserted by no check.
decision/cli-and-flow-targets-unix-gated · Command-line and flow targets unix-gated — The command-line check target and the shell flow target are gated to unix; the recording target is gated to unix item by item, beside an off-unix check that runs elsewhere.
decision/headless-screenshot · Headless screenshot from the harness — The harness paints a shot with no display through the CPU image renderer, composited over opaque white, at the harness's own time with no tick or pump.
contract/record-checks-script/failure-output · The committed checks' recording script · failure output — Prints only step N on failure.
contract/record-checks-script/rec-directory · The committed checks' recording script · rec directory — Makes its rec directory with mode 0700.

## 3-test-harness-contract · ## 3. Test Harness Contract
decision/shared-fixtures-in-one-module · Shared fixtures in one module — The fixture boot and hold, and every fixture more than one check reads, are stated once in one fixtures module with no test and no test target, holding no print, tracing call, env read, file, socket, listener or blitz_net. · except: a page with one reader, or whose ids differ, stays in its own check file
decision/vibey-selection-tests-shape-real-text · Vibey-script selection tests shape real text — blitz-vibey-script's dev-dependency on blitz-dom enables system-fonts. · why: so text inputs shape real text in the selection tests

contract/harness-construction/from-vdom · Harness construction · Harness::from_vdom — Harness::from_vdom(vdom, options) builds a Dioxus-backed harness and pumps once, first providing SeededRandom::from_seed(DEFAULT_SEED) as a root context where the vdom's root holds none; a root context the builder gave stands.
contract/harness-inspect/layout-rect · Harness inspection helpers · layout_rect — layout_rect(selector) returns a rect with x, y, width and height.
contract/harness-screenshot/fonts-unavailable · Harness screenshot · ScreenshotError::FontsUnavailable — A document whose can_paint_text reads false gives FontsUnavailable, with nothing painted.
contract/stand-boot/boot-load · seven_guis headless stand · stand::boot_load — stand::boot_load(HarnessOptions) boots the load page, TaskShell titled Load, its options' net_provider replaced by the stand's LoadNet and every other field kept.
contract/stand-boot/options · seven_guis headless stand · stand::options — stand::options(incremental) gives the pinned harness options the stand boots with.
decision/closed-spans-logged-as-lines · Closed spans logged as lines — The stand log carries closed spans its allowlist admits as a second record class beside printed events. · why: a boundary widening, ratified, as the obs-plan's log format states
decision/no-ids-or-names-in-stand-logs · No ids or names in stand logs — The stand binaries' stderr holds no stable id and no accessible name at any level up to trace, and the session host's none of the text typed. · guard: host_log, mcp_log, stand_act_spans
decision/scrolled-box-reads-where-it-stands · A scrolled box reads where it stands — For a box that is itself scrolled, layout_rect, layout_rect_of and center_of read where the box stands at every scroll offset of its own, in both layout modes, as the client bounding rect and the snapshot's bounds do. · why: ratified · guard: scrolled_box_absolute_position
contract/agent-run-selection/stand · agent-run run selection · stand — stand passes one --test per tests/blitz-tests/tests/stand_*.rs present; with none present it is an empty run, no cargo call, exit 1.
contract/agent-run-selections/stand · agent-run selections · run stand — Runs the `stand_*` readers of the shared module.
contract/command-span/screenshot · command span · screenshot — A shot's command line records verb, and cause when refused, never the image, its size or its dimensions.

## 4-unit-test-strategy · ## 4. Unit Test Strategy · twin unit-test-strategy
decision/blitz-tests-single-test-target · blitz-tests manifest holds one test target — The blitz-tests manifest does not set `autotests` to false and holds exactly one `[[test]]` table, `all`, with `test = false`. · why: the fork's standing two-line difference from upstream's manifest · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest

## unit-test-strategy · ## 4. Unit Test Strategy · twin 4-unit-test-strategy
contract/lint-findings/order · Lint findings · order — Lint findings come in document order, then in the stated order of the defects.
contract/refusal-causes/cause-set · Refusal causes · cause set — A closed set of eight causes in a stated order, `fonts-unavailable` the eighth; each name, meaning and remedy is a fixed text, the remedies pairwise distinct and no `/` in any.
contract/refusal-causes/printed-form · Refusal causes · printed form — A refusal's printed form opens with its cause's name and ends with its remedy.
decision/blitz-tests-manifest-difference · blitz-tests manifest's difference from upstream — The blitz-tests manifest leaves `autotests` on and holds exactly one `[[test]]` table, `all`, with `test = false`. · why: The fork's standing two-line difference from upstream's manifest. · guard: BlitzTestsTargetsTest
contract/driver-json/number · Driver JSON answers · number — A number is written as its shortest decimal, and as `null` when not finite.

## 5-integration-test-strategy · ## 5. Integration Test Strategy · twin integration-test-strategy
contract/driver-session/refused-call · driver session · refused call — A refused call leaves the instance unchanged and reads as a text holding none of the bytes the call supplied.
contract/driver-session/held-state · driver session · held state — One session booted through the stand holds state across commands and reads as a fresh boot, in both layout modes.
contract/driver-verbs/actions · driver verbs · actions — `actions` lists each served screen's actionable nodes with the table's verbs, every listed cause being what the call returns, in both layout modes, and changes nothing.
contract/driver-verbs/graph · driver verbs · graph — `graph` reads as the Dioxus document's graph on every served screen in both layout modes and changes nothing.

## integration-test-strategy · ## 5. Integration Test Strategy · twin 5-integration-test-strategy
decision/layout-tests-in-both-layout-modes · Layout assertions in both layout modes — Layout assertions run in both layout modes, non-incremental and incremental, as the pipeline tests do. · guard: incremental_oracle · except: Upstream integration targets taken in a sync are kept as written, and those that run one layout mode stand as named exceptions.
decision/refusal-leaves-instance-unchanged · Refusals change nothing and echo no input — A refused call leaves the instance unchanged and reads as a text holding none of the bytes the call supplied.
contract/refusal-cause/fonts-unavailable · driver refusal causes · fonts-unavailable — A call that needs fonts the instance lacks is refused `fonts-unavailable`, the instance unchanged.
contract/session-run/screenshot · escher_driver Session · screenshot — A `screenshot` returns the screen, or the element its optional id names, as a PNG equal to the harness's raster, and changes nothing.
contract/session-state-directory/session-sock · the session state directory · session.sock — The state directory holds session.sock alone; a kept recording lives in the launcher's recording directory.

## 6-e2e-test-strategy · ## 6. E2E Test Strategy · twin e2e-test-strategy
decision/checks-byte-equal-to-recording · Committed checks byte-equal to the binary's recording — The committed checks are recorded by escher-session and read byte-equal to what the binary records.
decision/checks-hold-no-screenshot-step · No screenshot step in committed checks — The scripts behind the committed checks hold no screenshot step. · why: a shot's PNG bytes differ by OS
decision/cli-checks-through-own-binary · Command-line checks through the package's own binary — Each escher-session driver command is run as a process of the package's own binary against a host its start command spawned.
decision/mcp-tested-as-child-and-in-process · MCP role tested as a child and in process — The binary's mcp role is tested as a child over piped stdin through the shared Speaker and in process in both layout modes.
decision/ui-driven-through-session-binary · App UI driven through the session binary — No test in the apps launches a window; the UI is driven through the escher-session binary.

## e2e-test-strategy · ## 6. E2E Test Strategy · twin 6-e2e-test-strategy
decision/no-screenshot-in-recorded-check-scripts · No screenshot step in committed recorded checks — The scripts that record the committed checks hold no `screenshot` step, so the kept checks stay byte-equal across operating systems. · why: a shot's PNG bytes differ by OS · guard: the_committed_checks_are_what_the_binary_records
contract/cli-refusal/remedy · escher-session CLI refusals · remedy — Every refusal cause the binary provokes reads a `remedy` equal to its cause's remedy in the table.

## 7-test-data-fixtures · ## 7. Test Data & Fixtures · twin test-data-fixtures
decision/shared-fixture-pages · Shared fixture pages stated once — A fixture page that more than one check reads is stated once as an rsx component and booted with the stand's options. · except: a page with one reader stays in its check's file
decision/stand-boots-offline · Stand boots offline — Every headless stand boot keeps no network provider, and no real network is used by the stand. · guard: the_stand_options_stay_offline · except: The stand load page's boot, which supplies the self-answering LoadNet stand-in, answering one fixed sheet from its own thread after a delay.
decision/checks-hold-no-private-data · Committed checks hold no private data — The committed checks hold no typed text, host path or secret.

## test-data-fixtures · ## 7. Test Data & Fixtures · twin 7-test-data-fixtures
contract/committed-checks/excluded-content · committed recorded checks · excluded content — A committed check holds ids, names, values, snapshot text and diffs, and no typed text, host path, secret or screenshot step.

## 8-mocking-stubbing-discipline · ## 8. Mocking & Stubbing Discipline · twin mocking-stubbing-discipline
decision/font-metric-tests-never-skip · Font-metric tests never skip — A font-metric test takes no skip path: it asserts its text-size precondition and fails rather than skipping. · why: The skip came from the fixture's no-namespace element, not from missing system fonts. · guard: hover_state_tests
decision/stand-pinned-real-font · Stand checks keep a real pinned font — The headless-stand checks use the bundled DejaVu Sans font, decoded through the native woff feature, with system fonts off.

## 9-ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin ci-integration
decision/bounds-reader-bodies-each-checked · Each bounds-reader body holds a check — Each of the two bodies of the engine's bounds reader, chosen by the writing-mode feature, holds a check of its own. · why: writing-mode is on in the workspace build only, so the same stand check runs over a different reader under each runner. · guard: scrolled_box_client_rect
decision/font-assertions-on-system-fonts · Font-dependent assertions on system fonts — Font-dependent assertions rely on the system-fonts feature, on by default when the whole workspace is tested. · except: Headless-stand checks use only the bundled DejaVu Sans with system fonts off, so they measure the same on any runner, the package-alone build included.
decision/stand-repeat-three-rounds · Stand checks repeated three rounds — The stand-repeat leg runs the stand checks and the named process checks for three rounds, the first red command ending the leg with its status, with no retry, no --ignored and no env var.
decision/ci-fast-slow-split · Fast/slow CI split — fmt, clippy, test-features-default and ci-scripts run first with no dependencies, and every other job, the platform matrix included, needs all four.
decision/ci-on-github-actions · CI on GitHub Actions — GitHub Actions is what runs the project's CI.
decision/ci-trigger-branches · CI trigger branches — Tests run on pull requests and on pushes to main, v0.* and build/** branches, escher's build branch included.
decision/per-package-green-not-workspace-green · Per-package green is not the workspace green — A green per-package test run is not the workspace test leg's green. · why: The two runs build the same test file against different engine features, tracing and writing-mode on in the workspace build only.

## ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin 9-ci-integration
decision/joining-file-keeps-its-legs · A file joining a leg keeps its legs — A test file joining a CI leg keeps every leg it already ran in.
decision/only-stand-repeat-frees-disk · Only the stand-repeat job frees disk — Only the Stand checks repeated job frees runner disk, with a pinned free-disk action after the toolchain and before the cache; the matrix job holds no free-disk step. · guard: test_only_stand_repeat_frees_disk

## 10-quality-gates-coverage-targets · ## 10. Quality Gates & Coverage Targets · twin quality-gates-coverage-targets
decision/stand-checks-zero-failure-budget · Zero-failure budget for stand checks — The stand checks, the named stand-repeat targets and seven_guis' process checks run three rounds in CI with no retry, and the first red command ends the leg red. · guard: Stand checks repeated job; test_stand_repeat_leg_runs_three_rounds
decision/per-crate-coverage-floors · Per-crate line coverage floors — The coverage leg ends by checking three per-crate line floors, escher-driver 97 %, dioxus-native-dom 83 %, blitz-test-harness 90 %, and fails when a crate is under its floor; workspace line coverage is read with no threshold. · why: Ratified as three crates, each floor one point below. · guard: coverage_floor.py; test_coverage_leg_reaches_the_floor_on_each_crate · except: dioxus-native-dom's keyboard_compat.rs, upstream's temporary keyboard-types bridge, is excluded until escher takes upstream's retirement of it.

## quality-gates-coverage-targets · ## 10. Quality Gates & Coverage Targets · twin 10-quality-gates-coverage-targets
decision/zero-failure-stand-repeat · Zero-failure flakiness budget for stand checks — The stand checks hold a zero-failure budget: the stand_*.rs files, the named blitz-tests targets and seven_guis' process checks run three times with no retry, and any failure fails the leg. · why: Ratified as a repeated job with zero failures. · guard: stand-repeat leg, job Stand checks repeated

## session-lifecycle · key of ## 3. Test Harness Contract
decision/no-screenshot-in-cross-os-checks · No screenshot step in cross-OS byte-compared checks — A check compared byte for byte across OSes, a committed check's digest included, holds no `screenshot` step; the shot path's kept form is covered by the recording test on linux and macOS. · why: A shot's PNG bytes differ between linux x86_64 and macOS aarch64. · guard: stand_session_recording
decision/replay-through-the-call-path · Replay through the ordinary call path — A kept check replays through the session's ordinary call path, whose signature and span stay unchanged, and its result types hold no reading and no JSON-library type. · why: Ratified.
contract/check-replay/stop · Check replay · stop — Each step's call runs validated again, and the replay stops at the first step whose acceptance differs or whose live kept line is not equal to the kept `answer`, naming the result fields that differ.
contract/driver-session/reading-verbs · Driver session · reading verbs — `snapshot`, `screenshot`, `lint` and `graph` run no step and wait on nothing.
contract/driver-session/screenshot · Driver session · screenshot — Returns a PNG of the whole screen, or of an element's bounds cropped to the visible part and rounded outward, changing nothing; a crop of no pixel is `off-screen`, an app with no font to paint text `fonts-unavailable`.
contract/driver-session/snapshot · Driver session · snapshot — Returns the screen's text, or, for a screen over the snapshot budget or a `part` asked, one part's text with the counts `part` and `parts`.
contract/session-recording/check-read · Session recording · Check::from_bytes — A kept check is read strictly, `answer` required as a JSON object; anything else is refused `malformed`.
contract/session-recording/record-fields · Session recording · record fields — Each answered instance call is recorded as `tool`, `arguments` in schema order, `masked`, `accepted`, `digest` (FNV-1a 64 over the whole written line) and `answer` (the kept line as a JSON object, a shot's without `png`).
decision/recording-checks-unix-gated · Recording checks unix-gated — A check that records is `cfg(unix)`-gated item by item, in-process and `mcp` stdio ones included, beside an off-unix check that a recording is refused `Unsupported`, which the windows job alone runs.
decision/session-checks-own-their-host · Session checks own their host — A check that needs a session process starts and stops its own host, bounds every wait, holds the host behind a guard that kills and reaps it, and sends the child's streams to null unless it reads them.
decision/socket-carries-commands · The socket carries commands — The session socket carries a call's element id and typed text in, and ids, accessible names, control values (a password's or file input's as the fixed mask), the snapshot's text, the diff and lint findings out. · why: Ratified, where until then none of them crossed.
decision/socket-session-checks-unix-gated · Socket session checks unix-gated — A check holding a session over the socket is `cfg(unix)`-gated; a check driving the `mcp` stdio child bounds every read, kills and reaps the child in its guard's drop and is not unix-gated, so the windows job runs it. · except: The `mcp_server` command-line comparison is unix-gated.
decision/two-clicks-without-advance-double-click · Two clicks with no advance are a double click — Under the virtual clock, two clicks with no `advance` between them are a double click. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_virtual_clock
contract/escher-session-command-line/lint · escher-session command line · lint — `lint` takes no argument; its accepted answer is one line `{"findings":[…]}`, status `0`.
contract/escher-session-command-line/snapshot · escher-session command line · snapshot — `--part` is a whole number 1 to 1000; a paged answer is one line `{"text":…,"part":n,"parts":m}`, status `0`; a whole screen still answers `{"text":…}` alone.
contract/escher-session-command-line/start · escher-session command line · start — `start <task> [--record <dir>]`, the task one of `counter` · `flight-booker` · `timer` · `crud`; with `--record` the recording directory is checked before anything is spawned, a refusal status `3` with nothing spawned.
contract/session-recording/check-file · Session recording · check file — `check-{n}.json` is created `0600`, never replacing a file, and rewritten whole through a `0600` temporary and a rename.
