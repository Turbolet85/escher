## threat-model-summary · ## Threat Model Summary
decision/coverage-check-files-untrusted · Kept check files read as untrusted — The coverage role reads each caller-named kept check as untrusted input through a bounded read and a strict parse; an unreadable, oversized, non-check or other-app file is refused malformed, holding nothing of the path or the file.
decision/lint-findings-crossing · Lint findings cross every ratified carrier — A lint's findings cross every ratified carrier as stable ids, closed defect words and numbers, never page text, colour or value.
decision/snapshot-state-readings · Three state readings per control — The snapshot text and the diff hold three state readings per control, selected, pressed and invalid, as closed words and booleans. · why: Inside the ratified crossing, ratified.
decision/file-url-only-for-file-documents · File URLs load only for file documents — A file: URL loads only for a file: document or a top-level load; for any other document, remote pages included, JS fetch, module import and script src refuse it with a FetchError, and blitz-net refuses the engine's stylesheet, @import, font, image and iframe loads before any disk read.
decision/select-list-crossing · Select list crossing limited to bounds and pixels — The select list crosses the ratified carriers only as a row's own bounds in the snapshot and the diff and as pixels in a shot; node state holds no field of it and no expanded node key stands.
decision/session-socket-carries-calls · Session socket carries calls and answers — The session socket carries the lifecycle and calls with their answers: an element id and typed text in; ids, accessible names, control values with a password's or file input's as the fixed mask, the snapshot text and the diff out; no NodeId crosses. · why: A boundary widening, ratified.

## input-validation · ## Input Validation
decision/aria-state-lowercase-exact-match · Control-state values matched exactly in lower case — `aria-selected`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-checked` and `aria-invalid` values are trimmed of ASCII whitespace and compared exactly, in lower case, against a closed set; an unrecognized value sets nothing, but for `aria-invalid`, which reads invalid. · why: A choice: the specification as read states no case rule and no browser was measured; the `aria-invalid` fallback is WAI-ARIA 1.2's rule. · except: A select's option reads its chosen state as selected, never `aria-selected`.
decision/boundary-widening-rule · Boundary widening rule — A new field of a closed value set inside an already ratified carrier is not a boundary widening, while a field holding authored text, an open value set, a new carrier or a new exit still is.
decision/closed-value-field-no-widening · A closed-value field in a ratified carrier is no widening — A new field of a closed value set inside an already ratified carrier is not a widening and needs no ratification; a field holding authored text, an open value set, a new carrier or a new exit still does. · why: Ratified as the standing rule.
decision/control-states-closed-values-only · Control states cross as closed values — Control states leave the process only as closed enums or booleans, on the accessibility adapter and in the snapshot's words and JSON booleans, never as the attribute's text, and no unrecognized or long value is written anywhere as typed. · why: A ratified widening of the adapter crossing by a new author-derived class.
decision/driver-outcomes-never-logged · Driver outcomes never logged — The driver crate logs and fields no command, call, argument, outcome, refusal, screen text, image, finding, session label or id record; an outcome is written only as a command-line answer, an MCP tool result, a session-socket reply or a recording file the caller asked for. · why: Outcomes leave the process only by the ratified crossing.
decision/lint-findings-closed-content · Lint findings hold no page content — A lint finding holds ids, closed defect words and numbers only, never page text, colour or a control value, and no log site, print, span or field carries a finding. · why: A ratified boundary widening.
decision/no-agent-urls-through-font-path · No agent URL through font sources — escher routes no agent- or user-supplied URL through the font-face source path.
decision/recorded-check-strict-reader · Recorded check is read strictly as untrusted — A kept check is read as untrusted bytes, at most 1,048,576 bytes and 400 records of closed keys; anything else is refused `malformed` with no fault, holding nothing of the file, with no panic path.
decision/recorded-check-untrusted · Recorded check bytes are untrusted — A kept check is read by a strict reader bounded in bytes and records, with closed keys and schema-named arguments, anything else refused as malformed holding nothing of the file, no panic path; every replayed step is validated again; the coverage role reads checks through the same reader.
decision/replay-through-session-run · Replay runs each step through the session — A replayed check runs each kept step through the session's own validated run alone, runs nothing on a session of another app and stops at the first step whose acceptance or kept answer differs.
decision/socket-carries-screen-reading · Session socket carries what the screen reads — An answer carries what the screen reads, ids, accessible names, control values with password and file input masked, snapshot text, diff, lint findings, UI graph, never a NodeId or an attribute value as typed. · why: The crossing was ratified.
decision/text-extent-read-only-none-when-unresolved · Text extent reader read-only with none answers — The text extent reader is read-only and answers none for an id that does not resolve or a node with no inline layout. · why: The text_extent test an_element_with_no_inline_content_reads_none pins the none answers; the escher-driver lint and stand_lint read it for truncation
contract/driver-session-reply/state-readings · driver session socket replies · state readings — State readings are carried as closed words and booleans.
contract/recorded-check/accepted · Recorded check file · accepted — One of the closed record keys, whether the call was accepted.
contract/recorded-check/answer · Recorded check file · answer — Required and a JSON object; key order is not enforced.
contract/recorded-check/arguments · Recorded check file · arguments — Argument names drawn from that verb's schema.
contract/recorded-check/digest · Recorded check file · digest — 16 lowercase hex characters.
contract/recorded-check/start-record · Recorded check file · start record — The array opens with `{"tool":"start","arguments":{"app":…}}`.
contract/recorded-check/tool · Recorded check file · tool — One of the ten instance verbs.
contract/snapshot-text/clickable · Snapshot text state words · clickable — Written after `focused` only when the element's current listeners hold `click` and it is no disabled form control.
contract/snapshot-text/id-field · Snapshot text · id field — Each node's id is written as a quoted `id=` field in the string's Debug form, so the field never holds a line break or a bare `"`; the snapshot has one text form and no JSON form, Display form or parser of the text.
contract/snapshot-text/invalid · Snapshot text state words · invalid — A bare word written for an element that states it is invalid.
contract/snapshot-text/name-field · Snapshot text · name field — Each line's accessible name is written as a quoted string in the string's Debug form, so a name holding a line break or a `"` stays inside its one field.
contract/snapshot-text/pressed · Snapshot text state words · pressed — A bare word written for an element that states it is pressed.
contract/snapshot-text/selected · Snapshot text state words · selected — A bare word written for an element that states it is selected.
contract/snapshot-text/state-words · Snapshot text · state words — Control states are written as the bare words `selected` / `unselected`, `pressed` / `unpressed` and `invalid`; in JSON answers they are booleans.
contract/snapshot-text/unpressed · Snapshot text state words · unpressed — A bare word written for an element that states it is not pressed.
contract/snapshot-text/unselected · Snapshot text state words · unselected — A bare word written for an element that states it is not selected.
contract/stable-element-id/stability · Stable element id · stability — A stable id is never a list index, pointer, hash, clock or process-local value, so a row reads the same id across a re-render, a remount and a second process.
decision/accessible-name-exits · Ratified exits of accessible names — Accessible names leave the process only through the platform accessibility adapter, a hosted call's answer in the snapshot text and diff JSON over the session socket and the client's stdout, and MCP tool results, and reach no log. · why: Each carrier ratified.
decision/accessible-names-not-logged · Accessible names kept out of logs — Escher's own code logs no accessible name, and a host that installs escher's sink writes none to stderr at any `RUST_LOG` level, the third-party record that carried one being dropped whole. · why: That third-party target is outside the sink's allowlist. · guard: mcp_log
decision/attribute-readers-no-log-or-panic · Markup attribute readers without log or panic — Markup attributes, remote pages included, are read from parsed content by in-process readers with no log site or panic path, ARIA states and closed values through closed parses carrying no attribute text.
decision/attribute-text-leaves-by-ratified-carriers · Attribute text leaves only by ratified carriers — Markup attribute values, names and descriptions leave escher only by the ratified carriers. · except: The page's own form submission and events.
decision/closed-driver-verb-schema · Closed driver verb schema — Every driver call is checked against a closed table of verbs and bounded argument kinds and answered with one typed command or one refusal, the first failure in a fixed order; a refused call changes nothing. · why: Each widening of the verb table is a widening of a validated surface, ratified.
decision/disabled-read-by-presence · disabled read by presence on form controls — The disabled attribute is read by its presence, whatever its value, and only on a button, input, select or textarea, for focusability, pointer and keyboard activation and the snapshot's enabled and clickable readings. · why: The presence reading was ratified.
decision/falsy-boolean-attribute-removed · Falsy boolean attribute removed — A falsy value of a listed boolean attribute clears the attribute rather than writing it. · why: The tests falsy_boolean_attributes_are_removed and every_listed_boolean_attribute_is_removed_when_falsy pin it; snapshot disabled readings depend on it
decision/file-urls-only-from-file-documents · file URLs load only from file documents — A script fetch, module import or script src, and every engine stylesheet, @import, font, image or iframe load, may read a file: URL only for a file: document or a top-level load, in every document, remote pages included; blitz-net refuses any other before a disk read. · why: A narrowing, not a boundary widening. · guard: remote_document_cannot_load_file_urls
decision/hintless-font-face-source-sniffed · Hint-less font-face source fetched and sniffed — An @font-face source whose URL cannot be resolved is skipped; a source with no format hint and no extension is fetched and its format sniffed from its bytes. · why: Ratified as upstream's behaviour, with a check asked for. · guard: font_face_sniffed_source
decision/inline-box-heights-finite · Inline-box heights kept finite — Inline-box heights are kept finite. · why: Huge author lengths cannot stall the line breaker.
decision/mask-holds-on-every-carrier · Value mask holds on every carrier — A masked value stays masked on every carrier the snapshot reaches: its text form, a diff, the driver's return, the session socket and MCP tool results. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_act_filled, stand_mcp_masked
decision/masked-input-values · Password and file input values masked — A password's or file input's value reads as the fixed `MASKED_VALUE` in the snapshot, its text, diffs and every carrier, never the text, its length or a file's host path. · except: The DOM and form submission keep the value.
decision/merged-aria-states-closed-parse · Closed parse of expanded, disabled and level — `aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled` and `aria-level` are read as closed values carrying none of the attribute's text and exit only on the accessibility adapter; `aria-disabled` moves no snapshot reading. · why: As upstream wrote them, inside the ratified states carrier. · guard: accessibility_merged_states
decision/no-echo-of-caller-input · No echo of caller input — No command-line ending writes back anything the caller typed: no path, label, id, value or file content.
decision/no-process-handle-crosses · No process-local handle crosses with an id — Neither the stable id, the snapshot, the diff nor any driver session, answer or refusal carries a `NodeId`, `ElementId`, `ScopeId` or pointer; only the stable id text crosses.
decision/password-file-value-masked · Password and file input values masked — The snapshot reads a password or file input's non-empty value as one fixed marker whatever was typed or chosen, an empty one as empty, never the text, its length or a file's host path. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_act_filled, stand_mcp_masked · except: The DOM is untouched: a file input's value attribute still holds the host path and form submission still carries it.
decision/session-socket-unix-only · Session socket is Unix only — The driver session socket exists on Unix only; elsewhere a session is `Unsupported`.
decision/stable-id-exits · Ratified exits of the stable id — The stable id leaves the process only through the platform accessibility adapter, the driver's answers over the session socket and the client's stdout, MCP tool results on the `mcp` role's stdout, and kept check files. · why: Each carrier ratified as a boundary widening.
decision/stable-id-not-logged · Stable ids kept out of logs — Escher's own code writes the stable id to no log, and a host that installs escher's sink drops third-party style records carrying an element's HTML id whole, printing that value at no `RUST_LOG` level. · why: Those third-party targets are outside the sink's allowlist.
decision/toggle-read-per-role · Toggle state read per role — `aria-checked` sets the toggle only on the five checkable roles and `aria-pressed` only on every other role; a native checkbox or radio reads neither attribute and gives its own checked state under a checkable role and nothing under any other. · why: Ratified.
decision/visible-region-open-list-row · Visible region of an open select list row — For a row or a group of an open select list, the visible region answers the list's scrollport. · why: An engine change for every document, ratified.
decision/visible-region-through-transforms · Visible region read through transforms — A clipping box's visible region is read through its transforms, exact under translate and scale, a rotation reading the rotated box's bounding box, and a mapped box with a non-finite edge answers none. · why: An engine change for every document, ratified. · guard: visible_region_transformed, stand_act_transformed, transformed_client_rect
contract/driver-command-span/cause · The driver command span · cause — The name of the returned refusal's cause, unrecorded until it applies.
contract/driver-session-reply/no-attribute-text · driver session socket replies · attribute text — A reply never carries an attribute's text.
contract/recorded-check/masked · Recorded check file · masked — True on a `type` record alone.
contract/recorded-check/masked-stand-in · A recorded check · MASKED_STAND_IN — The text "masked", with masked:true, stands for a recorded type to a masked or unresolved control.
contract/snapshot-value/masked-value · The snapshot's value · MASKED_VALUE — Eight U+2022 characters, one fixed marker standing for a password or file input's non-empty value on every carrier.
contract/stable-element-id/no-node-id · The stable element id · NodeId — No `NodeId` crosses any carrier of the stable element id.

## data-protection · ## Data Protection
decision/committed-counter-checks · Committed stand-Counter checks — The only committed kept checks are the two of the repository's scripted stand-Counter sessions, holding no typed text, host path, name or secret and no `screenshot` step, read only through the strict `Check::from_bytes`. · why: The one exception to a kept check's owner-only medium.
decision/kept-check-answer-whole · Kept check keeps each answer whole — A kept check keeps each answer as the line the driver wrote, masked as on every carrier, with a shot kept as its width and height and never its pixels. · why: Ratified, a shot's pixels excepted.
decision/kept-check-owner-only · Kept checks are owner-only — A recorded check is written 0600 into a 0700 directory the launcher named, is never logged, and is never removed by escher but for its own check when a recording ends. · why: Ratified. · guard: recording::the_committed_checks_are_what_the_binary_records · except: Two scripted stand-Counter checks, one through the command line and one through the mcp role, are committed publicly, holding no typed text, host path, name or secret and no screenshot step.
decision/kept-checks-owner-only · Kept checks owner-only and uncommitted — A kept check stays in an owner-only medium, is never logged and is never committed. · except: The two committed checks of the repository's own scripted stand-Counter sessions.
contract/kept-check-file/contents · Kept check files · contents — A kept check holds per call its verb, arguments, acceptance, digest and masked answer, never a pixel.
contract/kept-check-file/entry · Kept check file · entry — A check is a JSON array: the app label, then per answered call its verb, its arguments, its acceptance, a FNV-1a 64 digest of its written answer and the answer itself as answer.
decision/kept-check-call-content · Kept check call-content class — A kept check holds call content: target ids, press keys, advance ms and text typed into unmasked controls, a masked or unresolved type's text kept as MASKED_STAND_IN. · why: Ratified.

## api-security · ## API Security
decision/time-moves-only-on-advance · Time moves only on advance — Time on a held instance moves only when a caller asks for it with advance, 1 to 60000 ms a call; no driver verb has an argument or result field of a wait, and snapshot, screenshot, lint, graph and actions wait on no load.

## dependency-security · ## Dependency Security
decision/local-audit-before-push · Run the audit leg locally before a push — The local fast leg runs no audit, so the audit leg is run locally before a push. · why: A CI audit can go red on advisories published after a green audit with the lock and deny config unchanged.
decision/locked-builds · Locked builds — Every build, the flake, the bundle and every CI cargo leg, passes --locked so the lockfile is verified. · except: examples/wasm_hello, a standalone workspace with no Cargo.lock
decision/serde-json-read-only · serde_json, read only — serde_json, with no features and no preserve_order, reads the MCP server's untrusted stdin, a kept check's bytes and the driver's own answer line for replay, and writes nothing. · why: Chosen as read-only use.
decision/serde-json-untrusted-input-reader · serde_json as the untrusted input reader — serde_json, a workspace dependency with no preserve_order feature, is the reader of the MCP server's untrusted stdin, of a kept check's bytes and of the driver's answer line the replay compares.
decision/test-harness-no-tracing-no-style · Test harness takes no tracing and no style — blitz-test-harness takes neither the tracing crate nor the style crate as a dependency.
decision/cargo-deny-audit-tool · cargo-deny as the audit tool — cargo-deny 0.20.2, with the root deny.toml, is the dependency audit tool.
decision/dependency-audit-cargo-deny · Dependency audit with cargo-deny — cargo-deny checks advisories and licenses, locked, over the whole workspace's resolved graph with all features for the six platforms CI builds, configured by the root `deny.toml`, ignores per ID only, each with a written reason, re-read on every push. · why: Ratified: audit the whole workspace and check licences. · except: `unsound` stays at its default, which keeps memmap2's unsound advisory out of the gate.
decision/dependency-audit-ci-gate · Dependency audit CI gate — The CI audit job runs the dependency audit on every pull request and push, in the slow tier behind the fast jobs, uncached, its log uploaded on failure.
decision/free-disk-only-on-stand-repeat · Runner disk freed only for the repeated stand job — Only the `Stand checks repeated` CI job frees runner disk, with the free-disk-space action pinned to a commit; the `matrix_test` job holds no such step. · guard: test_only_stand_repeat_frees_disk
decision/licence-gate · Licence gate on every push — The audit leg runs upstream's licences table, held byte for byte in the root deny.toml, on every push over the whole workspace's graph, so the fork gates on licences. · why: An open question, decided as the fork's chosen option. · guard: the audit leg · except: upstream's own licenses job stays reverted

## bootstrap-phases-derive-for-route-setup-project · ## Bootstrap phases (derive for route / setup-project)
decision/telemetry-sink-target-allowlist · Telemetry sink target allowlist — escher's own log sink redacts engine-target messages and fields, redacts the content-named fields of escher targets, and drops every record from a target outside its two prefix sets at every level. · except: the upstream apps' stdout subscribers and the WPT runner's env_logger stay unscrubbed

## secret-management · ## Secret Management
decision/driver-reads-only-rust-log · Driver reads only RUST_LOG — The escher-driver library and the escher-session binary read no environment variable beyond RUST_LOG.
decision/live-evidence-holds-no-credentials · Live evidence holds no credentials — No committed live evidence, artifact, event or verdict carries a key, auth header, credential-file name, token field, e-mail address or the operator's login.

## error-handling · ## Error Handling
decision/ci-matrix-runs-every-job · CI matrix runs every job — CI matrix jobs run with fail-fast off, so one failing matrix job does not cancel its siblings.
decision/closed-refusal-cause-set · Closed refusal cause set — A driver command refusal is a typed value whose cause comes from a closed set of eight, with a fault only beside `malformed`; a new verb or argument shape is refused within the set, never by adding a cause. · why: The closed set of eight was ratified.
decision/refusal-closed-cause-set · Command refusal as a closed set of causes — An escher-driver command refusal is a typed value from a closed set of eight causes, each with a fixed name, meaning and remedy holding no path, and with no free-text field. · why: So a refusal cannot hold anything a call supplied. · except: A Fault is carried only beside the malformed cause.
decision/refusal-holds-no-call-input · A refusal holds nothing a call supplied — Every refusal's name, meaning and remedy is a fixed static text holding no path, and a fault carries at most the schema's own argument name, so a refusal cannot hold anything a call supplied.
decision/refusal-log-cause-name-only · Only a refusal's cause name is logged — Exactly one thing of a refusal reaches a log: its cause's fixed name, as the `cause` field of the call's driver span; no fault, meaning, remedy or display text is logged.
decision/refusal-logged-by-cause-name · Refusal logged by cause name only — Of an escher-driver command refusal, only its cause's fixed name reaches a log.
contract/refusal-causes/fonts-unavailable · Driver refusal causes · fonts-unavailable — One of the eight closed causes, returned by the executor, with a fixed name, meaning and remedy holding no path.
contract/refusal-json/cause · Refusal JSON · cause — The refusal's cause name, inside `{"refused":{...}}`, built from the cause's fixed strings.
contract/refusal-json/meaning · Refusal JSON · meaning — The cause's fixed meaning text.
contract/refusal-json/remedy · Refusal JSON · remedy — The cause's fixed remedy text.
decision/coverage-refuses-bad-checks-malformed · Coverage refuses an unusable check as malformed — The `coverage` role refuses a check file it cannot read, one past the check bound, one that is no check or a check of another app as `malformed`, holding nothing of the path or the file, and adds no cause.
decision/stale-node-ids-never-panic · Stale node ids never panic — A stale node id is skipped in layout children and resolves to none on lookup rather than panicking; a stale animation entry for a removed node is skipped on the next resolve. · guard: stale_interaction_state, stale_node_mapping, animations and custom_widget_layout tests
contract/cli-exit-codes/1 · escher-session CLI exit codes · 1 — The call was refused; the refusal JSON is written to stdout.
contract/cli-exit-codes/3 · CLI exit codes · 3 — Session error: the error object with kind, message and remedy on stdout and its fixed message on stderr; a boot that fails ends with its session error.
contract/query-apis/missing-element · Query APIs · missing element — Query APIs return Result<Option<NodeId>>, and a missing element is None.

## logging-monitoring · ## Logging & Monitoring
decision/no-screen-content-in-logs · Screen content stays out of logs — No driver call puts screen content in a log: typed text, element ids, accessible names, a shot's image, lint findings, a part's text, a UI graph, an actions answer and a coverage check reach no log line at any level. · guard: stand_act_spans, host_log and mcp_log, read at RUST_LOG=trace under both builds
contract/command-span/cause · The command span line · cause — Recorded when the call is refused, as a closed cause word such as fonts-unavailable.
contract/escher-session-output/caller-text · escher-session output · caller-typed text — No output line echoes a caller's argument but the admitted request id the mcp role echoes; an answer carries each node's current value, so text typed into an unmasked control returns, a masked input reading only the mask.
decision/session-output-holds-no-caller-input · Session output holds no caller input — No escher-session output line holds anything the caller typed. · except: The mcp role's echoed request id.
decision/tracing-for-engine-logging · tracing for engine logging — Engine crates log through the tracing crate behind an optional tracing feature, and their logging macros compile only with that feature on.
contract/command-span/line · The command span line · line — A sink-installing host writes one closed command span line per call it runs.
contract/command-span/verb · The command span line · verb — Records the instance-level verb; a graph or actions call records the verb alone, plus cause when refused.
contract/escher-session-output/accepted-stderr · escher-session output · stderr of an accepted command — An accepted command's stderr is empty with RUST_LOG unset.
