## 1-test-scope-summary · ## 1. Test Scope Summary · twin test-scope-summary
decision/ci-scripts-unit-tested · CI Python scripts unit-tested — The CI Python scripts are unit-tested by unittest discovery over the CI scripts directory, run as the fast ci-scripts leg, contract tests of the CI install, coverage floor and blitz-tests manifest scripts among them. · guard: ci-scripts leg
decision/driver-executor-integration-tested · Driver executor tested by integration checks — The driver's executor verbs, its refusals and the session lint are tested by integration checks, not unit tests. · why: the driver crate depends on nothing that names a virtual DOM, so a unit test cannot build a held instance
decision/workspace-tests-in-fast-ci-leg · Workspace tested in the fast CI leg — Every CI run tests the whole workspace with a locked lockfile on ubuntu with default features, as the fast test leg.
decision/dedicated-headless-test-harness · Dedicated headless test harness — Blitz documents are tested headlessly through a dedicated, unpublished harness crate.

## test-scope-summary · ## 1. Test Scope Summary · twin 1-test-scope-summary
decision/advance-moves-exactly-the-ms-asked · Advance moves exactly the time asked — An advance reports exactly the ms asked whatever the step does: the step is handed exactly ms, advanced_ms equals ms, and the clock moves by exactly ms. · why: ratified · guard: stand_act_timer
decision/driver-instance-verbs-tested-by-stand · Driver verbs over a held instance tested by integration — The driver's executor verbs and its readings over a held instance are covered by integration checks, not unit tests, and its JSON writer's node rows are unit-tested over plain parts. · why: The driver crate depends on nothing that names a virtual DOM, so a unit test cannot build a held instance.
decision/eight-refusal-causes-in-order · Eight refusal causes in a fixed order — The driver's refusal causes are eight, named in a fixed order with `fonts-unavailable` last, each stating its meaning and a distinct remedy, and a refusal reads as its cause's name, then its remedy. · why: Ratified. · guard: the_eight_causes_are_named_in_order
decision/failed-load-ends-settle-wait · Failed load ends the settle wait — A failed load ends the harness and driver settle wait, so a failed stylesheet does not leave the document not settled on loads for good. · why: the harness test a_failed_stylesheet_reaches_the_document_through_the_counter_and_unblocks_it pins it, and the driver's load wait settles through the same harness settle
decision/open-pseudo-class-follows-attribute · Open pseudo-class follows the open attribute — The `:open` selector matches a details or dialog element carrying `open`, set at construction and kept on each write or removal of the attribute. · why: open_state pins it at construction, on mutator write and removal, and on summary click and Enter, read through an author :open rule
decision/stand-checks-in-both-layout-modes · Stand checks run in both layout modes — A stand check that reads a screen asserts its readings in both layout modes, and the two modes' readings are held equal where the check compares them.
decision/unrun-declared-write-reads-unconfirmed · Declared write unrun after its event reads unconfirmed — The UI graph reads a declared write unconfirmed once its handler's event passed through its element and no run wrote the state, so a conditional write reads unconfirmed after runs that skipped it. · why: graph's a_declaration_that_drifts_from_the_code_reads_both_flags pins the flag, and stand_graph needs GRAPH_DRIVES to run each conditional write to read no flag
contract/driver-command-span/one-line-per-call · driver command span · command line — Each call run through the session leaves exactly one escher_driver line at INFO, its span reading command, carrying no field outside the stated eight and none of the ids, names or supplied texts.
contract/driver-refusal-causes/fonts-unavailable · driver refusal causes · fonts-unavailable — A screenshot or lint on an app with no usable font is refused fonts-unavailable with nothing changed.
contract/driver-refusal-causes/malformed · driver refusal causes · malformed — An id longer than 1024 bytes is refused malformed before any lookup.
contract/driver-refusal-causes/not-found · driver refusal causes · not-found — An id no screen of the session read, or that no element carries, is refused not-found.
contract/driver-refusal-causes/stale · driver refusal causes · stale — An id an earlier screen of the session read that names no element now is refused stale.
decision/advance-reports-exact-ms · Hosted advance reports exactly the ms asked — A hosted advance moves the timer session with no sleep, and every ask reports exactly the milliseconds asked. · why: Ratified. · guard: host_timer
contract/escher-session-stderr/no-ids-names-or-typed-text · escher-session stderr · ids, names and typed text — Even at trace level, stderr holds no stable id, no accessible name, no typed text and no screenshot bytes.

## 2-test-strategy · ## 2. Test Strategy · twin test-strategy
decision/incremental-differential-oracle · Incremental layout differential oracle — Incremental layout is checked by running one fixture and mutation sequence in an incremental and a non-incremental document, comparing every node's final layout, layout children and paint tree after each step and asserting no damage remains. · guard: incremental_oracle
contract/driver-refusals/fonts-unavailable · Driver refusals · fonts-unavailable — A shot of a document whose font context resolves no sans-serif family is refused with nothing painted and no skip path, and the actions read names the same fonts-unavailable for screenshot.
decision/recorded-checks-replayed-as-tests · Recorded checks replayed as tests — A check a session recorded is committed as data and run as an ordinary cargo test target, every step re-validated through the session and red at the first step whose acceptance or kept answer differs.

## test-strategy · ## 2. Test Strategy · twin 2-test-strategy
decision/handler-coverage-by-replay · Handler coverage measured by replay — Handler coverage replays kept checks, each on a fresh session, reads the UI graph at boot and after each replayed step, and lists the handlers no check exercised, so recorded checks also measure what they leave unexercised.
decision/shot-refused-without-fonts · Shot refused without a usable font — A shot of a document whose font context resolves no sans-serif family is refused with nothing painted and no skip path. · guard: stand_act_screenshot, stand_mcp_tools, font_reading_tests
contract/handler-coverage-limits/bubbling-dispatch · Handler coverage limits · bubbling dispatch — A bubbling dispatch counts every ancestor listener it passed.
contract/handler-coverage-limits/canvas-handler · Handler coverage limits · canvas handler — A handler inside a canvas is not counted.
contract/handler-coverage-limits/unreached-screen · Handler coverage limits · unreached screen — A handler on no screen a replay reached is not listed.
contract/harness-settle/notsettled · The harness's settle · NotSettled — Returned when work is still due after settling, naming the Busy class that holds it; otherwise Settled.
decision/harness-driven-tests · Harness-driven engine tests — Engine tests drive any document through the test harness, which supplies deterministic construction defaults, a pump and tick loop, a settle loop repeated until no work is due, inspection helpers and input synthesis.
decision/mcp-capture-counts-by-span · MCP child capture counted by span — A check capturing the mcp child counts its log lines by span and target, each tool call span the parent of that call's command line.
decision/stable-tree-serialization · Stable tree serialization — The harness produces a stable one-node-per-line tree serialization with geometry. · why: Suitable for snapshot-style assertions.
decision/stand-checks-bundled-font · Stand checks under a bundled font — The headless-stand checks have no skip path and assert unconditionally under the bundled DejaVu Sans, with system fonts off. · except: The pre-existing font-dependent tests skip at runtime when no usable font is available.
contract/escher-session-commands/coverage · escher-session commands · coverage <app> <check>... — Lists the handlers no given recorded check exercised.

## 3-test-harness-contract · ## 3. Test Harness Contract
decision/closed-spans-logged-as-lines · Closed spans logged as lines — The stand log carries closed spans its allowlist admits as a second record class beside printed events. · why: a boundary widening, ratified, as the obs-plan's log format states
decision/harness-virtual-clock · Harness time is a virtual clock — The harness's time is a virtual clock its documents read, moved by tick and advance_time; screenshot, screenshot_rect, text_contrast and settle never move it. · why: ratified
decision/no-ids-or-names-in-stand-logs · No ids or names in stand logs — The stand binaries' stderr holds no stable id and no accessible name at any level up to trace, and the session host's none of the text typed. · guard: host_log, mcp_log, stand_act_spans
decision/timer-step-carries-remainder · Timer step carries its remainder — The stand's timer step returns nothing and carries its remainder below one tick across calls, and a driver session moves its clock on every advance. · why: ratified
contract/harness-core/dispatch · Harness core · dispatch — dispatch does not pump.
contract/harness-core/dispatch-recorded · Harness core · dispatch_recorded — dispatch_recorded([UiEvent, ...]) returns the list of dispatched event names and does not pump.
contract/harness-input/input-helpers · Harness input helpers · input helpers — Each input helper (click, tap, drag, press, type_text, wheel_at, scroll_into_view, ime and the rest) pumps after dispatch.
decision/bridge-tests-without-widening · Bridge tests without widening visibility — The event-bridge tests sit in a cfg(test) child module of the Dioxus document module, and no function under test gains a constructor or a pub for them. · why: DioxusEventHandler's two fields are private to that module and it has no constructor · except: the one cfg(test) shim, DioxusDocument::dispatch_to_vdom, which dispatches a chain into the vdom for a bridge test
decision/cold-agent-server-log-counted-only · Cold-agent server log counted, never shown — The server's log is read only to count its tool-call span lines, their refused and error endings and each counted verb's accepted lines; it is never printed or copied.
decision/harness-reexports-key-types · Harness re-exports keyboard types — The test harness re-exports keyboard-types' Key, Modifiers and NamedKey, the types press_with takes and the named-key enum a Key::Named holds. · why: so a crate that depends on the harness, escher-driver among them, names a key with no dependency of its own
decision/python-script-tests-under-unittest · Python script tests under unittest — The Python tests of the CI scripts run under the standard library's unittest, by discovery over the CI scripts directory.
decision/scrolled-box-reads-where-it-stands · A scrolled box reads where it stands — For a box that is itself scrolled, layout_rect, layout_rect_of and center_of read where the box stands at every scroll offset of its own, in both layout modes, as the client bounding rect and the snapshot's bounds do. · why: ratified · guard: scrolled_box_absolute_position
decision/telemetry-target-allowlist · Telemetry target allowlist — A record from an engine target prints only its safe fields, one from an escher_ target prints with its content-named fields redacted, and one from any other target is dropped whole, at every level and whatever RUST_LOG names. · guard: telemetry_scrub, telemetry_drop
contract/command-span/graph · command span · graph — A graph call's command line records verb alone under its tool_call parent.
contract/command-span/screenshot · command span · screenshot — A shot's command line records verb, and cause when refused, never the image, its size or its dimensions.
contract/command-span/verb · command span · verb — verb and tool_call's tool are closed sets of words, help, screenshot and graph among them, added with no span field.
contract/harness-input/clipped-click · Harness input helpers · click on a clipped element — A raw click on an element lying outside the padding box of a box that clips it does not land on it.
contract/harness-input/key-event · Harness input helpers · key_event — Synthesized key events use Code::Unidentified and Location::Standard and fill text only for pressed character keys.
contract/harness-input/pointer-coordinates · Harness input helpers · pointer coordinates — Synthesized pointer events set page, screen and client coordinates to the same values.
contract/harness-input/pointer-event · Harness input helpers · pointer_event — The harness crate exports a pointer_event(id, x, y, button, buttons, mods) builder.
contract/harness-settle/busy-loads · Harness settle · NotSettled { busy: Loads } — After a quiet pass, a request in flight or a pending render-blocking resource makes settle return NotSettled { busy: Loads } at once.
contract/harness-settle/failed-load · Harness settle · failed load — A failed stylesheet load reaches the document and stops counting as a pending render-blocking resource, so settle does not read NotSettled { busy: Loads } for it.
contract/harness-settle/settle · Harness settle · settle — settle(&mut self) -> Result<Settled, NotSettled> repeats the pump pass until a quiet pass (poll answered false, the hover node did not change, no load finished) and returns Settled { passes, animating }.
contract/harness-settle/settle-pass-limit · Harness settle · SETTLE_PASS_LIMIT — SETTLE_PASS_LIMIT (64) passes with none quiet make settle return Render, Loads or Layout, read off the last pass.
contract/harness-settle/side-effects · Harness settle · side effects — settle reads no clock but the harness's, advances no time, waits on no load, neither reads nor drains the changed set and logs nothing; pump and the input helpers never settle.
contract/stand-boot/options · seven_guis headless stand · stand::options — stand::options(incremental) gives the pinned harness options the stand boots with.
contract/stand-log/command-span · Stand log · command span — escher-session's host role writes one closed command span line under escher_driver per call it runs through Session::run, the same with a recording held.
contract/stand-log/event-line · Stand log · event line — One line per printed event: {RFC 3339 UTC time} {LEVEL} {target} service.name={name} service.version={version} then {field}={value} pairs.
contract/stand-log/span-line · Stand log · span line — One line per closed span the allowlist admits: the event prefix, then span={name}, the span's fields in recorded order, message="close", time.busy and time.idle; no line when a span is created, recorded to, entered or exited.

## unit-test-strategy · ## 4. Unit Test Strategy · twin 4-unit-test-strategy
decision/mutation-controlled-tests · Tests controlled red-before-green — A new check is controlled: a named mutation of what it guards turns it red, and the restored tree reads green again.
decision/one-actionable-rule · One actionable rule for both readers — Both actionable readers read one rule from an element's current listeners, never from the `data-dioxus-id` mark. · why: The mark outlives a listener removed on a re-render, so a reading of it would still count that listener. · guard: a_listener_removed_on_a_re_render_is_read_by_neither_reader
contract/driver-verbs/level-check · Driver verbs · level check — A verb is checked at its own level only: a session-level verb given as an instance call is refused `unknown-verb` before its arguments are read; the session commands and `help` are admitted at session level, an argument to `help` refused `malformed`.
contract/element-id/virtual-form · Element ids · virtual form — The form `{owner}///{key}` is reserved: no id the walk writes holds the virtual separator, and a key that is empty or holds `/` makes no virtual id.
contract/harness-settle/pass-limit · The harness's settle · pass limit — Work for ever ends after exactly the settle pass limit of polls, reading Render.
contract/refusal-causes/cause-set · Refusal causes · cause set — A closed set of eight causes in a stated order, `fonts-unavailable` the eighth; each name, meaning and remedy is a fixed text, the remedies pairwise distinct and no `/` in any.
contract/coverage-line/owner · The coverage line · owner — A handler's `owner` is left out when it has none.
contract/coverage-line/shape · The coverage line · shape — One JSON object `{"unexercised":[{"id":…,"owner":…,"event":…}],"checks":n,"held":m}`, keying each unexercised handler.
contract/driver-verbs/lookup · Driver verbs · lookup — A verb is found by its exact name only; a name differing in case or padding finds nothing.
contract/driver-verbs/verb-table · Driver verbs · verb table — Fourteen verbs in a stated order at three levels — `instance`, `session`, `tool` — each with help, arguments and at least one result field.

## 5-integration-test-strategy · ## 5. Integration Test Strategy · twin integration-test-strategy
decision/recorded-dispatch-bypasses-document · Recorded dispatch bypasses document handling — Harness input reaches the document through its real event-dispatch pipeline without a window, while recorded dispatch bypasses document-specific handling such as Dioxus forwarding. · why: pointer_leave, touch_events and range_input_interaction read event names through dispatch_recorded while other checks drive the real pipeline through dispatch
contract/driver-log/default-level · the driver's log line · default level — At the default level the driver writes no line.
contract/driver-log/per-call-line · the driver's log line · per-call line — With escher's sink at `info`, each call run through the session leaves exactly one `escher_driver` line of fixed words and counts only, none of the ids, names, values or typed text it handled.
contract/driver-session/held-state · driver session · held state — One session booted through the stand holds state across commands and reads as a fresh boot, in both layout modes.
contract/driver-session/refused-call · driver session · refused call — A refused call leaves the instance unchanged and reads as a text holding none of the bytes the call supplied.
contract/driver-session/run · driver session · run — A call run through the session returns after settle with the diff of the snapshots taken before and after it.
contract/driver-verbs/actions · driver verbs · actions — `actions` lists each served screen's actionable nodes with the table's verbs, every listed cause being what the call returns, in both layout modes, and changes nothing.
contract/driver-verbs/graph · driver verbs · graph — `graph` reads as the Dioxus document's graph on every served screen in both layout modes and changes nothing.
decision/host-stderr-no-screen-content · Host stderr carries no screen content at trace — A host that installs escher's sink, the `mcp` role and a recording session's clients write no id, name or typed text on stderr at `trace`, a paged part read included. · guard: host_log
decision/session-writes-no-screen-content · Session writes nothing of the screen — The session library and the harness path write nothing of the screen (typed text, a stable id, an accessible name) to stdout, to stderr or into the state directory.

## integration-test-strategy · ## 5. Integration Test Strategy · twin 5-integration-test-strategy
decision/actions-answer-holds-no-value · Actions answer holds no value — An actions answer carries ids, owner ids, the table's verb words, cause words and booleans only, never a value, never a masked value and no internal node id field. · guard: stand_actions
decision/advance-accepted-on-every-session · advance accepted on every session — The `advance` verb is accepted on every session, never refused for the session it addresses. · why: ratified
decision/change-event-from-engine-only · change events come from the engine alone — A page's script hears one `change` per change, fired by the engine; the script runtime synthesizes none. · guard: radio_click_fires_change_only_where_it_was_not_checked
decision/driver-log-fixed-words-only · Driver log lines hold fixed words and counts only — At `info` each call run through `Session::run` leaves exactly one `escher_driver` line of fixed words and counts, never the ids, names, values or typed text it handled; at the default level no driver line. · guard: stand_act_spans
decision/graph-answer-holds-no-value · Graph answer holds no value — A graph answer carries ids, component names, handler event names, state names, closed flag words and booleans only, never a value such as typed text. · guard: stand_graph, cli_commands, mcp_server, stand_mcp_tools
decision/graph-signal-registration · Task state registered for the UI graph — The stand registers each task's signals through a graph-state hook subscribed to the signal, so writers and reading components reach the UI graph through the fork's signal registry, with no dioxus-core change. · why: Hook-local signal state exposes neither link without a fork-level change, the scope's hooks being crate-private. · guard: graph::tests, stand_graph
decision/handler-coverage-bubbling-counts-ancestors · Bubbling dispatch counts every ancestor listener — A bubbling dispatch counts every ancestor listener it passed as exercised, `stopPropagation` unread.
decision/handler-coverage-canvas-uncounted · Canvas handlers not counted by handler coverage — Handler coverage does not count a handler inside a canvas.
decision/handler-coverage-holds-no-typed-text · Handler coverage line holds no typed text — Text typed during a replayed check never reaches the handler coverage line. · guard: stand_handler_coverage
decision/handler-coverage-reads-every-replayed-screen · Handler coverage reads every replayed screen — Handler coverage reads every screen the replays reach, the UI graph read at boot and after each replayed step.
decision/handler-coverage-unreached-screens · Handlers on unreached screens not listed — Handler coverage does not list a handler on a screen no replay reached. · why: by construction
decision/harness-click-waits-on-nothing · Harness click waits on no load — A check that needs a load in flight uses the harness's `click`, which waits on nothing, while a driver `click` waits out `LOAD_WAIT`. · why: stand_actions' load_in_flight helper clicks load-fetch through the harness to hold the fetch in flight, and stand_contrast waits out the load itself afterwards
decision/layout-tests-in-both-layout-modes · Layout assertions in both layout modes — Layout assertions run in both layout modes, non-incremental and incremental, as the pipeline tests do. · guard: incremental_oracle · except: Upstream integration targets taken in a sync are kept as written, and those that run one layout mode stand as named exceptions.
decision/listeners-read-from-vdom-walk · Listeners read from the vdom walk — A node's current listeners are read from the vdom walk's dynamic attributes, mounted included, not from the bridge's listener attributes. · why: The bridge's listener attributes over-report: a listener removed on a re-render leaves its attribute standing, and a mounted listener writes none. · guard: dioxus_runtime_probe link_2_a_removed_listeners_attribute_stays
decision/load-wait-bound · Acting steps wait out loads in flight — An acting step that meets a load in flight waits for it up to `LOAD_WAIT`, five seconds of wall time, settling again every 10 ms and moving no virtual time; at the bound it ends not settled with `busy` `Loads`. · guard: stand_load_wait
decision/refusal-leaves-instance-unchanged · Refusals change nothing and echo no input — A refused call leaves the instance unchanged and reads as a text holding none of the bytes the call supplied.
decision/reserved-graph-id-form · Reserved owner-key id form — No served id holds the reserved `{owner}///{key}` form. · guard: stand_graph
contract/actions-command/argument · the actions command · argument — An argument to actions is refused malformed.
contract/graph-command/argument · the graph command · argument — An argument to graph is refused malformed with nothing run.
contract/handler-coverage/refused-step · handler coverage · refused step — A refused step exercises no handler; a keyboard activation exercises the element's click handler.
contract/refusal-cause/covered · driver refusal causes · covered — A target a hit at its centre does not reach is refused `covered`; the fixed meaning also says an option of a closed select lies under it, to click the select first and then the option.
contract/refusal-cause/disabled · driver refusal causes · disabled — A call on a disabled target is refused `disabled`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/fonts-unavailable · driver refusal causes · fonts-unavailable — A call that needs fonts the instance lacks is refused `fonts-unavailable`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/malformed · driver refusal causes · malformed — A malformed call is refused `malformed`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/not-found · driver refusal causes · not-found — A call naming an id not on the screen is refused `not-found`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/off-screen · driver refusal causes · off-screen — A target outside its scrolling box's view, or an element shot cropping to no pixel, is refused `off-screen`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/stale · driver refusal causes · stale — A call naming a stale id is refused `stale`, the instance unchanged.
contract/refusal-cause/unknown-verb · driver refusal causes · unknown-verb — A call naming no known verb is refused `unknown-verb`, the instance unchanged.
contract/session-act/settle · escher_driver Session · act — A step run through `Session::act` returns settled, or `SessionError::NotSettled(Busy::Render)` at the bound with the instance still readable.
contract/session-host-stderr/command-span · the session host's stderr · command span — Exactly one command span line is written per call.
contract/session-run/changed-node-states · escher_driver Session · acting call result — An acting call returns the node it changed with its `selected` or `invalid` reading as it reads after the step.
contract/session-run/diff · escher_driver Session · run — A call run through `Session::run` on a held session returns after settle with the diff of the snapshots taken before and after it.
contract/session-run/graph · escher_driver Session · graph — The `graph` verb answers the document's UI graph, every graph node a snapshot node, changing nothing and holding no typed text.
contract/session-run/scroll · escher_driver Session · scroll — A `scroll` is refused for none of the three checks that stand in front of a click and says in its result whether its element is then in view.
contract/session-run/type · escher_driver Session · type — A `type` replaces what a filled control holds and an empty text clears it; a masked control's written form holds the mask, never the typed text.
contract/session-run/type-on-select · escher_driver Session · type on a select — A `type` on a single-choice select chooses the first option whose label starts with the text, its diff naming the select with `value` and the options whose `selected` moved.
decision/session-logs-no-screen-content · Session logs nothing of the screen — The session library, the session host and its mcp role write no typed text, stable id, accessible name or shot bytes to stdout, stderr or the state directory, at any log level. · guard: stand_session_quiet, host_log, mcp_log
decision/typed-password-never-returned · Typed passwords never returned — A password typed through the driver occurs nowhere in what the call returns, reads `MASKED_VALUE`, and never leaves as pixels in a screenshot. · guard: stand_act_screenshot, stand_act_filled
contract/handler-coverage/other-app-check · handler coverage · check of another app — A check recorded on another app contributes nothing to the coverage.
contract/session-host-stderr/service-name · session host stderr lines · service.name — Every line the escher-session host writes to stderr carries `service.name=seven_guis`.
contract/session-run/screenshot · escher_driver Session · screenshot — A `screenshot` returns the screen, or the element its optional id names, as a PNG equal to the harness's raster, and changes nothing.

## e2e-test-strategy · ## 6. E2E Test Strategy · twin 6-e2e-test-strategy
decision/select-list-painted-by-paint-scene · Select list painted by the scene painter alone — The harness, the session and the binary drive the select list headlessly because the list paints through `paint_scene` alone, with no shell or renderer code of its own. · why: the harness screenshot, the session's screenshot of an open-list row in stand_act_popup and select_popup_painted all read the open list with no shell present
contract/command-span/actions · driver command span · actions — An `actions` tool call parents one `command` span that records `verb` alone.
contract/cli-coverage-role/stdout · escher-session CLI coverage role · coverage line — Replaying a kept check prints the handlers it left in one coverage line on stdout, status 0.

## 7-test-data-fixtures · ## 7. Test Data & Fixtures · twin test-data-fixtures
decision/harness-counts-fetching-providers-only · Harness counts loads of fetching providers only — Harness documents always use HtmlProvider, and only a fetching net_provider is wrapped in the load counter that settle reads. · why: settle reads in-flight loads off the counter; the settle tests and stand_settle's load-in-flight check rely on a fetching stand-in being wrapped

## test-data-fixtures · ## 7. Test Data & Fixtures · twin 7-test-data-fixtures
decision/graph-drives-confirm-every-write · Shared graph drives exercise every stand write — The graph and handler-coverage checks rely on the shared graph drives driving each stand task's conditional writes once, so no stand write reads a flag. · why: stand_graph's every_stand_tasks_declarations_agree_with_its_code_once_its_handlers_have_run and stand_handler_coverage both run GRAPH_DRIVES and read no flag

## 8-mocking-stubbing-discipline · ## 8. Mocking & Stubbing Discipline · twin mocking-stubbing-discipline
decision/settle-never-advances-time · Settle never advances time — Settle neither advances the timer nor waits on a tick not yet delivered.
contract/driver-advance/advance · the driver's advance command · advance — Moves the session's clock by exactly ms inside one settled step.
contract/driver-advance/advanced-ms · the driver's advance command · advanced_ms — Is exactly ms, the clock's move, not what the Timer's counter gained.

## mocking-stubbing-discipline · ## 8. Mocking & Stubbing Discipline · twin 8-mocking-stubbing-discipline
decision/timer-driven-by-delivered-ticks · Timer driven by delivered ticks — In every headless-stand boot the Timer's real delay is replaced by delivered 100 ms ticks applied on the next pass; settle neither advances the timer nor waits on an undelivered tick. · guard: stand_timer, stand_settle
decision/advance-moves-clock-by-exactly-ms · Advance moves the virtual clock by exactly ms — The driver's advance moves the session's clock, the harness's VirtualClock that every harness-built document reads, by exactly ms inside one settled step, and advanced_ms reports exactly ms, not what the Timer's counter gained. · why: ratified · guard: stand_act_timer
decision/advance-reports-clock-move · advance reports the clock's move — advanced_ms is exactly the ms asked, the clock's move, not what the Timer's counter gained. · why: Ratified.

## 9-ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin ci-integration
decision/local-baseline · Local baseline for CI comparison — The local baseline is the dev host, the dev profile with line-tables-only debug info, workspace default features, every cargo command locked and no opt-level rewrite; cold is the first run after a clean, warm an immediate re-run. · why: It is the reference the fork's CI is compared against.
decision/local-pre-push-gate · Local pre-push gate — The fast leg runs fmt, clippy, test, ci-scripts and embolden in that order, stopping at the first red, as the local pre-push gate.
decision/per-package-green-not-workspace-green · Per-package green is not the workspace green — A green per-package test run is not the workspace test leg's green. · why: The two runs build the same test file against different engine features, tracing and writing-mode on in the workspace build only.
decision/embolden-leg-local-only · Embolden witness leg without a CI job — The font-embolden witness leg runs locally and has no CI job of its own. · why: macOS exercises the feature in CI

decision/clippy-legs · Clippy over the workspace and upstream blitz-dom — The clippy leg runs over the workspace, then, only when green, over upstream's blitz-dom no-default-features line with warnings denied.
decision/embolden-local-witness · Local witness for font-embolden paint — A paint change under the OS-gated font-embolden feature has its local witness in the embolden leg, the last of the fast legs, which has no CI job. · why: macOS exercises the feature in CI, and the leg's command reproduces macOS's numbers on linux. · guard: test_fast_leg_ends_on_the_font_embolden_witness; select_popup_painted
decision/msrv-1-91 · Minimum supported Rust version — CI builds the workspace with Rust 1.91 as the minimum supported version.

## 10-quality-gates-coverage-targets · ## 10. Quality Gates & Coverage Targets · twin quality-gates-coverage-targets
decision/mutation-baseline-read-per-unit · Mutation baseline read per unit — A mutation run skips cargo-mutants' own baseline and first reads each unit's test command green on the unmutated tree. · why: cargo-mutants' baseline tests the mutated package alone.
decision/mutation-testing-dev-host-only · Mutation testing on the dev host — Mutation testing is cargo-mutants run with nextest under a fail-fast mutants profile, on the dev host alone and never in CI.

## quality-gates-coverage-targets · ## 10. Quality Gates & Coverage Targets · twin 10-quality-gates-coverage-targets
decision/complexity-ceiling-host-only · Cognitive-complexity ceiling read on the host — The cognitive-complexity ceiling of 15 is read on the dev host alone, test functions counted; no CI leg runs it, it binds no function, and engine functions over it are left as they are.
decision/mutation-baseline-skipped · Mutation baseline skipped, read green by hand — Mutation runs skip cargo-mutants' baseline; each unit's mutant test command is first read green on the unmutated tree. · why: cargo-mutants' baseline tests the mutated package alone yet passes every test argument, so a test set naming other packages cannot be its baseline and would read every mutant caught.
decision/mutation-runs-on-dev-host-only · Mutation runs on the dev host only — Mutation runs are made on the dev host alone, never in CI. · why: cargo-mutants and cargo-nextest are host tools no lockfile resolves.
decision/mutation-runs-under-nextest-profile · Mutation runs with cargo-mutants under nextest — A mutation run is cargo-mutants with nextest as its test tool under a dedicated mutants profile that stops at the first failure and runs the direct tests first, the default profile untouched. · why: Under plain cargo test, hung integration binaries run before the library tests and make mutants read timeout.

## session-lifecycle · key of ## 3. Test Harness Contract
decision/advance-moves-clock-exactly · advance moves the clock exactly — Every session accepts `advance`, which moves the session's clock by exactly the asked milliseconds and then runs the caller's time step where one was handed. · why: Ratified.
decision/replay-through-the-call-path · Replay through the ordinary call path — A kept check replays through the session's ordinary call path, whose signature and span stay unchanged, and its result types hold no reading and no JSON-library type. · why: Ratified.
contract/driver-session/act · Driver session · act — Runs one step on the held harness and waits for quiet; an instance not quiet is `NotSettled(Busy)`, one still loading at the bound `NotSettled(Loads)`; the step is not rolled back, and nothing it reads or returns crosses the socket.
contract/driver-session/acting-verbs · Driver session · acting verbs — `click`, `type`, `press`, `advance` and `scroll` are each one settled step that waits on a load in flight and returns the diff of the snapshots before and after; `scroll` adds `in_view`.
contract/driver-session/graph · Driver session · graph — Returns `Outcome::Graphed` holding the screen's `UiGraph`.
contract/driver-session/load-wait · Driver session · LOAD_WAIT — A load in flight is waited for up to 5 s of wall time, settled again every 10 ms, no time moving on the held instance; a failed load ends the wait.
contract/driver-session/not-settled-result · Driver session · settled — A verb on an instance that did not go quiet is a result, `settled` false with its `busy` class, and is not rolled back.
contract/driver-session/reading-verbs · Driver session · reading verbs — `snapshot`, `screenshot`, `lint` and `graph` run no step and wait on nothing.
contract/driver-session/refusal-order · Driver session · refusal order — A `click` or `type` on an element that cannot take it is refused with the first that holds of `disabled` · `off-screen` · `covered`, leaving the snapshot and both focus readings as they were.
contract/driver-session/run-carriers · Driver session · run carriers — The instance call path is the one thing a host does with a `call` request and the MCP server with an instance verb's tool call.
contract/driver-session/run-validation · Driver session · run — A call is validated first, and a refused call has run nothing.
contract/driver-session/screenshot · Driver session · screenshot — Returns a PNG of the whole screen, or of an element's bounds cropped to the visible part and rounded outward, changing nothing; a crop of no pixel is `off-screen`, an app with no font to paint text `fonts-unavailable`.
contract/driver-session/session-verb-in-run · Driver session · session-level verb — `start`, `status` or `stop` handed to the instance call path is refused `unknown-verb`.
contract/driver-session/snapshot · Driver session · snapshot — Returns the screen's text, or, for a screen over the snapshot budget or a `part` asked, one part's text with the counts `part` and `parts`.
contract/driver-session/stale-or-not-found · Driver session · stale · not-found — An id that names no element on the screen as it reads now is refused with nothing run: `stale` when the session's record of read ids holds it, `not-found` when not.
contract/driver-session/type-replaces · Driver session · type — After the focusing click, where the snapshot reads a value for the target, the driver selects all and types, so an empty text clears the control; a select is focused with no click and no DOM focus event.
contract/session-wire/graph-answer · Session wire · graph answer — Carries ids, owner ids, component names, registered state names, handler event names, the declared writes, the flag words `undeclared` · `unconfirmed` and booleans — never a value or typed text, and no `NodeId`.
decision/two-clicks-without-advance-double-click · Two clicks with no advance are a double click — Under the virtual clock, two clicks with no `advance` between them are a double click. · why: Ratified. · guard: stand_virtual_clock
contract/driver-session/id-record · Driver session · record of ids — Holds id text only, at most 4096 ids, for the session's life, no id longer than `MAX_ID_BYTES`, read by nothing outside the crate.
contract/escher-session-command-line/no-echo · escher-session command line · caller input — No ending writes back anything the caller typed.
contract/session-errors/error-set · Session errors · error set — Fifteen session errors, each stating a kind, a fixed meaning and a remedy; the state directory's message states its bound.

## session-lifecycle · key of ## 3. Test Harness Contract
overview/session-lifecycle — The session checks drive one headless app instance held by one process, and a lifecycle another process drives, with the calls it sends, over a Unix-domain socket. The session is not part of the five-command agent-run contract, which starts and binds nothing.
