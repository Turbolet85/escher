# layout-templates · the rows that bind 2026-11-13-cognitive-load-corrective — picked 73 of 120 (36 by every draw) · rule any · pin 627

## surface-desktop-native · ## Surface: desktop-native
decision/crud-list-keyboard-region · CRUD list as one keyboard region — The CRUD list is one Tab stop whose ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Home and End move the selected row and fill the name fields as a click does; focus stays on the list, never a row, and no aria-activedescendant is read. · why: Ratified as a decision.
decision/every-stand-control-keyed · Every stand control keyed — Every actionable element of all seven stand tasks carries an author id, so no actionable element reads unkeyed, an open dialog included.
decision/flight-type-select-boot-reading · Flight type select reads its two options at boot — The snapshot reads the flight booker's mode select at boot as ComboBox "Flight type" with value one-way and two ListBoxOptions, each at the select's client rect. · why: the_flight_type_select_holds_its_two_options in stand_snapshot pins role, name, value, both ListBoxOptions and their select-rect bounds in both layout modes
decision/headless-stand-pinned-viewport · Headless stand pinned viewport — The headless stand skips Home and mounts one task in TaskShell at a pinned 800 × 600, scale 1.0, Light viewport with the bundled DejaVu Sans.
decision/held-instance-reads-as-fresh-boot · Held instance reads as a fresh boot — A session's held instance reads as a fresh boot, and the TaskShell mount and the pinned viewport hold after commands, in both layout modes. · guard: stand_session_fresh
decision/open-list-rows-own-bounds · Open list rows read their own bounds — While a select list is open each row reads its own bounds in the snapshot and the diff, and after a close the rows read back at the select's client rect. · why: stand_act_popup checks a click opening the list names each row's bounds in the diff, and escape closing it puts the rows back at the select's box
decision/scroll-into-view-moves-every-scroller · Into-view scroll moves every holding scroller — An into-view scroll moves every scrolling box that holds its target, innermost first, and then the viewport, in every document. · why: Ratified for every document. · guard: stand_act_scroll · except: A row of an open select list is scrolled into view by writing the list's scroll offset at once, no scrolling box or viewport moving.
decision/session-roles-share-stand-boot · Session roles share the stand boot — Every escher-session role that boots a task (host, mcp, coverage) boots it through the same stand boot the command line uses, adding no markup, id, class, style, wrapper or order.
decision/stand-a11y-by-attributes-alone · Stand names, roles and states by attributes alone — Stand controls take accessible names, roles and states by attributes alone (for, aria-label, aria-invalid, role, aria-selected), adding no element, class, style, key, id or order, the classes that style invalid and selected states staying.
decision/stand-ids-as-attributes-alone · Stand ids as attributes alone — Author ids on stand elements are added as attributes alone, moving no element, class, style, wrapper or order, and no stand CSS selects by them.
decision/stand-lints-clean-at-boot · Stand lints clean at boot — At boot the counter, the flight booker, the timer, CRUD and the load page read zero visual-lint findings, in both layout modes. · guard: stand_lint
decision/visible-region-through-clipping-boxes · Visible region through clipping boxes — The part of the viewport an element can be seen through is the viewport narrowed to the padding box of every clipping box that holds it, in every document. · why: Ratified for every document. · except: A row or group of an open select list is seen through the list's scrollport alone, no clipping box answering.
contract/stand-element-ids/crud-create · Stand stable element ids · crud-create — Stable author element id of the CRUD task's Create button.
contract/stand-element-ids/crud-delete · Stand stable element ids · crud-delete — Stable author element id of the CRUD task's Delete button.

contract/stand-element-ids/crud-person-id · Stand stable element ids · crud-person-{person.id} — Each CRUD row's stable author element id, from its person's model-assigned id beside the same Dioxus key, following its person under filter, Create and Delete.

contract/stand-element-ids/load-fetch · Stand stable element ids · load-fetch — Stable author element id of the load page's Load button, taking Enter and Space.
decision/fixed-document-skeleton-main-mount · Fixed document skeleton with main mount — Every document starts with the fixed skeleton html, head, body and main id="main", and the app mounts into main. · why: stand_snapshot's tree_follows_the_task_shell reads the single /html:0 root with nothing under head, and the bridge's own crash test counts the app's children under main
decision/load-page-only-network · Load page alone has a network provider — Only the load page's boot has a network provider, an in-process stand-in answering after 200 ms from a thread of its own, so a driver click on load-fetch waits it out; every other boot keeps no network provider. · guard: stand_load_page
