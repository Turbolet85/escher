## color-palette · ## Color Palette
decision/engine-colours-hardcoded · Engine colours hardcoded — The engine's own select colours (chosen row, open list highlighted row, disabled row and border) are fixed hardcoded values; the open select list's are constants of the select list view, not in the default sheet. · why: The engine holds no tokens.
decision/select-chosen-row-chromium-pair · Select chosen row takes Chromium's inactive selected pair — A multiple select's chosen row is painted with Chromium's inactive selected pair, a #c8c8c8 background with #000000 text. · why: Follows Chromium's inactive selected pair; hardcoded as the engine holds no tokens. · guard: select_interaction
decision/select-list-colours-engine-constants · Select list colours as engine constants — The open select list's colours are engine constants, not design tokens and not in the default stylesheet; its highlight is the same pair as a multiple select's chosen row. · why: The engine holds no design tokens.

## typography · ## Typography
decision/screenshot-never-skips-text · Screenshot never paints with text skipped — A driver screenshot of an app whose font context resolves no sans-serif family is refused with nothing painted, so a shot never paints text skipped.
contract/driver-screenshot-refusals/fonts-unavailable · driver screenshot refusals · fonts-unavailable — A screenshot is refused fonts-unavailable, with nothing painted, when the app's font context resolves no sans-serif family.
contract/driver-screenshot/fonts-unavailable · driver screenshot · fonts-unavailable — A `screenshot` of an app whose font context resolves no `sans-serif` family is refused `fonts-unavailable` with nothing painted; a shot never paints with text skipped.

## spacing · ## Spacing
decision/select-list-placed-in-viewport · Open select list placed inside the viewport — An open select list is placed inside the viewport, at least its select's width and at most the viewport's, every edge finite. · why: pinned by every_edge_of_a_placed_list_is_finite and hostile_markup_keeps_every_box_finite_and_panics_nowhere

## depth-strategy · ## Depth Strategy
decision/open-select-list-hit-first · Open select list answers hits first — hit, set_hover_to, handle_pointerdown and the driver's covered all read the open select list first, so a button under the list is refused covered. · why: the driver's covered check reads it; pinned by a_button_under_the_list_is_refused_covered and the covered fixture in stand_actions
decision/select-list-painted-after-root · Select list painted after the root render — The open select list paints after the root's render and the blend layers, so it stands above every box of the page. · why: pinned by a_list_paints_whole_past_an_opacity_ancestor_and_a_box_that_clips_its_select; driver screenshots of an open list read it
decision/hit-testing-stops-at-paint-clip · Hit-testing stops at a paint clip — Hit-testing stops at the padding box of a node that clips paint, by overflow or by a computed contain including paint: a point outside that box reaches none of the node's hoisted children, paint children or inline content, while the node itself is still answered inside its border box. · except: The root element; a row of an open select list is answered before the walk, so a box clipping the select clips no row.

## motion-calibrated-to-expression-level-unrecorded · ## Motion (calibrated to expression level `unrecorded`) · twin motion
decision/driver-scroll-instant · Driver scroll is instant — The driver's scroll is instant in every scrolling box and in the viewport, made inside one settled step. · why: Ratified.
decision/into-view-scroll-instant-in-nested-boxes · Into-view scroll instant in nested boxes — A programmatic into-view scroll never animates a nested scrolling box: every scrolling box holding its target is written at once, innermost first, and the requested behaviour, Smooth included, applies to the viewport alone. · except: Into view on a row of an open select list writes that list's own scroll at once, moving no other box and no viewport.
decision/load-wait-moves-no-clock · Load wait moves no clock — While an acting driver step waits on a load in flight, for at most LOAD_WAIT, the harness's VirtualClock stands still, so no timer or animation runs during the wait.
contract/driver-verbs-and-virtual-clock/advance · driver verbs and the virtual clock · advance — The driver's advance moves the VirtualClock by exactly its ms and, through the step a session's caller hands it, the app's own time together.
contract/driver-verbs-and-virtual-clock/click · driver verbs and the virtual clock · click — The driver's click leaves the VirtualClock where it was.
contract/driver-verbs-and-virtual-clock/press · driver verbs and the virtual clock · press — The driver's press leaves the VirtualClock where it was.
contract/driver-verbs-and-virtual-clock/type · driver verbs and the virtual clock · type — The driver's type leaves the VirtualClock where it was.
decision/animation-driven-by-virtual-clock · Animation driven by the virtual clock — The test harness drives animation from the VirtualClock its documents read, and settle reads animation time only through that clock, never advancing it.

## motion · ## Motion (calibrated to expression level `unrecorded`) · twin motion-calibrated-to-expression-level-unrecorded
decision/driver-advance-moves-one-clock · Driver advance moves the one virtual clock — The driver's advance moves the harness virtual clock by exactly its ms and the app's own time together, while click, type and press leave the clock where it was. · why: Ratified.
decision/into-view-scroll-nested-boxes-instant · Into-view scroll is instant in nested boxes — A programmatic into-view scroll writes every scrolling box that holds its target at once, innermost first, whatever behaviour was asked; the requested behaviour, Smooth included, applies to the viewport alone. · why: The document holds one scroll animation at a time.
decision/select-list-opens-without-motion · Select list opens and closes with no motion — The select list has no motion, so a screen read after a step reads the new state without an advance. · why: pinned by a_screen_read_after_a_step_reads_the_new_state_with_no_advance in the stand_act_popup driver tests
decision/smooth-scroll-behavior-and-wheel-cancel · scroll-behavior smooth animates, wheel cancels — scroll-behavior smooth makes Auto scrolls animate, and a wheel over a scroller cancels an in-progress smooth scroll. · why: pinned by fragment_link_uses_smooth_scroll_behavior_from_root_style, fragment_link_uses_auto_scroll_behavior_from_root_style and wheel_scroll_cancels_smooth_scroll

## surface · ## Surface: desktop-native · twin surface-desktop-native
decision/actions-share-the-verbs-checks · actions decided by the verbs' own checks — The actions answer reports whether each call would be accepted, not what it would do, deciding a node's verbs by the same validation and per-verb target check every id-taking verb meets before it acts. · why: so a listed cause is the cause the call returns
decision/boxless-focused-select-keeps-focus · Focused select with no box keeps focus and keys — A focused select whose container lost its box keeps focus and takes a key with no panic. · why: pinned by a_select_made_inert_disabled_hidden_or_removed_with_its_list_open_closes, which presses a key after hiding the select's container
decision/buffered-render-replay · Render buffered, then replayed under one borrow — On every Dioxus document, windowed and headless alike, a render is recorded into a mutation buffer with the document unborrowed, then replayed under one borrow. · why: so code the vdom runs during a render, a component body or a polled task can call MountedData's methods with no RefCell already borrowed panic
decision/escher-session-agent-read-surface · escher-session is read by an agent, not a person — An escher-session command prints one line of JSON on stdout, the answer, the refusal or a session error's object keyed by the driver schema's own words, and nothing else there.
decision/escher-session-no-colour · No colour and no terminal test on escher-session — escher-session uses no colour and no colour dependency, writes no ESC byte on any answer line or MCP reply, and never asks whether a stream is a terminal, so its output is the same piped or not. · guard: the seven_guis checks' shared reader and the shared Speaker assert no ESC byte on every line
decision/exit-statuses-from-schema-table · Exit statuses read from the schema's table — The exit statuses are read from the driver schema's EXIT_STATUSES table, whose meanings help serves.
decision/select-list-engine-overlay · Select list as an engine overlay — On desktop-native a single select's open list is an engine overlay that reaches the screen through the scene paint alone, not a second OS window and not rows as boxes.
decision/selects-that-open-no-list · Selects that open no list — A disabled, inert or hidden select, a select with no row to show and a multiple select open no list. · why: pinned by a_disabled_inert_hidden_singular_or_empty_select_opens_nothing in the select_popup tests
decision/single-select-open-gestures · Click, Enter or Space opens a single select — A single select's list opens on a click, Enter, or a Space with no typed text standing. · why: pinned by a_click_enter_and_space_open_the_list_on_its_chosen_option_and_fire_nothing and enter_and_space_open_the_list_and_a_released_space_does_nothing_more

contract/escher-session-commands/coverage-answer · escher-session commands · coverage answer — coverage replays each named kept check of the app on a fresh session and answers one uncoloured line {"unexercised":[{"id","owner","event"}],"checks":n,"held":m} on stdout, status 0: the handlers no given check exercised, read at boot and after each step.
contract/escher-session-commands/graph-answer · escher-session commands · graph answer — graph answers the screen's whole UI graph as one uncoloured line of JSON {"nodes":[…],"states":[…]} on stdout, status 0, the same on the session socket's call and in a kept check; over the mcp role the tool result is the text block of that line.
contract/escher-session-commands/graph-arguments · escher-session commands · graph arguments — graph takes no argument; an argument is refused malformed with nothing run.
contract/escher-session-commands/screenshot · escher-session commands · screenshot [--id] — screenshot answers one uncoloured line {"width":…,"height":…,"png":"<base64>"} on stdout with no ESC byte, status 0, the image as base64 text inside the line.
contract/escher-session-commands/snapshot · escher-session commands · snapshot [--part <part>] — snapshot answers one uncoloured line with no ESC byte, status 0: {"text":…} for a whole screen and {"text":…,"part":n,"parts":m} for a screen read in parts.

contract/escher-session-mcp/screenshot-result · escher-session mcp role · screenshot tool result — A screenshot answers two content blocks: an image block (mimeType image/png, the PNG as base64) then a text block holding the shot's line without png.
contract/escher-session-mcp/snapshot-result · escher-session mcp role · snapshot tool result — A snapshot's tool result text is the screen text, or its JSON line {"text","part","parts"} for a screen read in parts.
contract/escher-session-mcp/stdout · escher-session mcp role · stdout — stdout holds newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol lines only, a reply per request that is not a notification, every reply one uncoloured line with no ESC byte; its end writes nothing there.
